## Part 1: Definitions
=================================================================

This section will contain the formal mathematical definitions for:
- Core types (Phenotype Y, PGS P, Principal Components PC).
- The Phenotype-Informed GLM structure.
- Baseline models (Raw Score, Normalized Score).
- The four Data-Generating Process (DGP) scenarios.

(Implementation to be added here.)

## Part 2: Theorems and Proofs
=================================================================

This section will state and prove the core claims of the framework.

/-! ### Claim 1: Formalization of Scenarios

**The four scenarios can be mathematically formalized with precise data-generating processes.** Each scenario corresponds to a specific relationship between the true E[Y|P,PC], the distribution of P given PC, and the causal structure—allowing us to define exactly when we're in each scenario rather than relying on verbal descriptions.
-/

/-! ### Claim 2: Necessity of Phenotype Data

**Scenarios 1 and 4 can produce identical PGS distributions but require opposite signs for the optimal interaction coefficient.** Formally: ∃ two data-generating processes where P|PC has identical distributions, but optimal prediction requires γ₁ₗ > 0 in one case and γ₁ₗ < 0 in the other along the same PC axis—proving phenotype data is mathematically necessary.
-/

/-! ### Claim 3: Independence Condition

**When PGS and PC are statistically independent, all interaction terms vanish in the optimal predictor.** Specifically: if Corr(P, PC_l) = 0 for all l in the population, then the Bayes-optimal prediction function has γ_ml = 0 for all m ≥ 1, l ≥ 1, reducing to a standard additive GLM.
-/

/-! ### Claim 4: Prediction-Causality Trade-off

**No method can simultaneously minimize prediction error and provide unbiased causal effect estimates in scenarios with PC-correlated environmental confounding.** This is a fundamental impossibility result: optimizing for prediction accuracy by leveraging environmental correlations is mathematically incompatible with estimating pure genetic effects.
-/

/-! ### Claim 5: Bayes-Optimality within Model Class

**The phenotype-informed method achieves Bayes-optimal prediction within its model class.** Among all functions in the linear-in-parameters GLM family with the specified basis functions, the phenotype-informed method minimizes E[(Y - f(P,PC))²], while raw and normalized methods are constrained to more restrictive subclasses.
-/

/-! ### Claim 6: Parameter Identifiability

**The model parameters are identifiable under standard GLM conditions.** Given linearly independent PCs and basis functions (non-singular design matrix), the parameters γ = {γ_ml} are uniquely determined by the population distribution of (Y,P,PC).
-/

/-! ### Claim 7: Quantitative Error of Normalization

**Normalization reduces accuracy in Scenario 1 by exactly the explained variance.** When true genetic effects correlate with PCs, normalization's prediction error increases by R²(genetic_effect, PC) × Var(genetic_effect) compared to the oracle predictor.
-/

/-! ### Claim 8: Quantitative Bias of Raw Scores

**Raw scores produce maximally biased predictions among unbiased linear predictors in pure Scenario 4.** When PC-correlated PGS differences are entirely due to neutral drift with no outcome association, raw score predictions exhibit bias equal to β_P × Cov(P,PC) × PC for each individual.
-/

/-! ### Claim 9: Correction of Multiplicative Bias

**Under pure multiplicative bias, the Bayes-optimal parameters exactly correct the distortion.** If E[Y|P,PC] = f(k(PC)×P) where k(PC) represents ancestry-specific PGS scaling, then the optimal parameters satisfy γ₁ₗ ∝ ∂log(k)/∂PC_l, exactly undoing the bias.
-/

/-! ### Claim 10: Shrinkage Effect

**Heteroscedastic PGS noise induces shrinkage-like calibration coefficients.** When Var(P - P_true | PC) varies with ancestry, the method automatically learns coefficients that shrink predictions toward ancestry-specific means in proportion to the local noise level.
-/

/-! ### Claim 11: Invariance to PC Transformation

**The method is invariant to affine transformations of PC space.** For any invertible linear transformation A and translation b, fitting the model with PC' = APC + b yields identical predictions Ŷ, ensuring results don't depend on arbitrary choices in PC computation.
-/

/-! ### Claim 12: Limitation - Extrapolation Risk

**Model predictions are unreliable for individuals outside the training PC support.** The calibration function learned from data in a bounded PC region cannot be guaranteed to extrapolate correctly to individuals with PC values far outside this region, constituting a fundamental limitation for application to unrepresented ancestries.
-/

/-! ### Claim 13: Limitation - Context Specificity

**Models are context-specific and may not transfer between environments.** A model trained in one environment is optimally calibrated only if PC-outcome associations (including environmental confounding) remain constant; different PC-environment correlations in a new setting will reduce predictive accuracy.
