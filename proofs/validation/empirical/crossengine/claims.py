"""Corpus bodies under cross-engine test, each with competitors on the SAME cells.

The identity gate is the competitor test, and it is free.  A body that agrees
with a simulation proves nothing unless a DIFFERENT body, evaluated on the same
cells, is rejected.  Every claim here therefore carries competitors, and one of
them -- named `PLANTED` -- is known to be wrong by construction.  If the
harness ever fails to reject `PLANTED`, the harness is broken and its MATCHes
are worthless; `run.py` treats that as a hard failure, not a warning.

Claims are keyed to the Lean definition they test.  Do NOT anchor anything here
to a line number: definitions move every few minutes.  `def_name` is the anchor.
