"""Engine provenance of empirical verdicts -- the gate-eligible half.

    python3 provenance.py            # exit 1 on any GATING finding
    python3 provenance.py --all      # also list the DIAGNOSTIC findings

The simulations in this directory can never be a required check: their verdicts
are statistical, so at any sample size they carry a false-failure rate.  This
script is the deterministic consequence of them.  It reads the committed
`results.json` and the Lean sources, and it is fast, dependency-free and pinned
to no line number.

Two kinds of finding:

GATING (budget 0) -- a claim that cross-engine measurement showed to be
    RESTRICTED has silently dropped its restriction.  `results.json` records
    which claims were rejected on which cells; if such a definition's docstring
    goes back to reading as an unrestricted validation, the corpus has lost a
    fact it paid for.  This is a real defect and it fails deterministically.

DIAGNOSTIC (not gating) -- a definition claiming VALIDATED whose provenance
    shows only coalescent engines, i.e. it has never met a forward simulator.
    That is the normal state of most of this corpus today, so it is reported
    and not gated; gating it would fail on ~77 definitions from day one, which
    is a survey, not a check.
