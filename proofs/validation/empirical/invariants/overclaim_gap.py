"""Find docstrings that claim more than their theorem proves.

WHY

A Lean theorem cannot be false. Its docstring can, and the docstring is what a
reader takes away. The gap between them is the one defect class the kernel
cannot catch, and it is the same class as proof laundering: the statement is
sound, the claim attached to it is not.

Two shapes are checkable from the sources alone.

EQUIVALENCE CLAIMED, ONE DIRECTION PROVED

A docstring saying "exactly when", "if and only if", "precisely when" or
"necessary and sufficient", attached to a statement with no `↔`.  Sometimes the
converse sits in an adjacent theorem and the package really is an equivalence,
so this reports rather than accuses -- but each entry has to be checked, because
the honest version is cheap:

    constantConditional_driftDefect_zero  said the defect vanishes "exactly
    when" the conditional does not drift, and proved only that a constant
    conditional has zero defect.  The converse needed six lines and a positivity
    hypothesis that turned out to matter: an ancestry of weight zero contributes
    nothing to the defect and its conditional is unconstrained.

ORDER CLAIMED, INSTANCE PROVED

A docstring asserting a general ordering -- "more X means more Y" -- attached to
a closed numeric instance.  The failure mode is real and was found here by
external review: a resolution/defect co-monotonicity claim held along nested
information filtrations and failed for unrelated predictors, with a two-bit
counterexample.  See `MetricSpecificPortability.lean`, where the counterexample
is now formalised beside the nested statement.

WHAT TO DO WITH AN ENTRY

Three honest repairs, in order of preference: prove the converse; weaken the
docstring to what the statement says; or formalise the counterexample that shows
the general reading is false. The third is the most valuable, because it stops
the claim being re-made.
