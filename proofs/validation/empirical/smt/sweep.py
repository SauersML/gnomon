"""Corpus-wide sweep for VACUOUS and TAUTOLOGICAL theorem statements.

    python3 sweep.py selftest     # both-directions calibration; run this first
    python3 sweep.py scan         # sweep proofs/Calibrator/

STATUS: DIAGNOSTIC.  Needs z3, and the scan is a minute rather than the ~20s
the gated empirical steps get in total, so it is not wired into prover.yml.
`selftest` alone is fast and dependency-light enough to promote later.

WHAT THIS IS FOR.  The corpus has no `sorry` and no custom `axiom`, so every
statement in it is kernel-checked and none of them can be FALSE.  Counterexample
search therefore has nothing to find, and the two defects that can still hide
behind a valid proof are:

    VACUOUS      the hypotheses contradict each other, so the theorem is true
                 and says nothing about anything;
    TAUTOLOGICAL the conclusion holds with no hypotheses at all, so every
                 biological premise in the statement is decoration.

SOUNDNESS, which is the entire design.  There is no verified Lean-to-SMT
translator here and there is not going to be one.  Instead every construct that
cannot be translated is replaced by something STRICTLY MORE PERMISSIVE:

    unknown definition  f a b     ->  an uninterpreted real function
    unparseable hypothesis        ->  DROPPED entirely
    unparseable subterm           ->  a fresh unconstrained real

Relaxing or dropping hypotheses can only ENLARGE the set of models.  So:

    z3 says UNSAT on the hypotheses
      => the real hypothesis set is unsatisfiable too
      => VACUOUS, soundly.

and symmetrically, UNSAT on a negated conclusion with no hypotheses asserted
means the conclusion is valid under every interpretation, hence a tautology.
SAT carries NO information under this encoding and is never reported.  That
asymmetry is what makes the sweep trustworthy without a verified translation --
and it is also its limitation: the sweep cannot tell you a statement is fine,
only that it failed to prove it degenerate.

A SECOND LIMITATION, stated because a reader will otherwise over-read the
redundancy output: the redundancy probe removes ONE hypothesis at a time.
Hypotheses that are each individually redundant are frequently not JOINTLY
redundant, so this output does not license removing several at once.  The
sound way to drop premises is to scan the kernel-accepted proof term for
binders that do not occur in it -- and even that is only valid against the
statement it was computed on, which is how a correct trim and a correct
inversion combined into a false theorem in AssortativeMatingPGS.lean.

Measured 2026-08-04 on the whole corpus: 0 vacuous of 1861 checkable
hypothesis-carrying theorems, 0 tautological of 1065 checkable conclusions.
