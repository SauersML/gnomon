"""THE RELATION TABLE: which metamorphic relations each definition must satisfy.

A metamorphic relation is a transformation of the INPUT whose effect on the
OUTPUT is known exactly.  It needs no oracle, so unlike a simulation verdict it
admits no convention argument: if `hudsonFst` changed when you relabel which
allele is called reference, that would be a defect under every convention, and
there is nothing to negotiate.  That is what makes this table gateable.

WHAT IS DECLARED HERE

  SWEPT_MODULES   Lean modules I have gone through definition by definition.
                  Every extractable scalar `ℝ → ℝ` definition in a swept module
                  MUST appear in RELATIONS or in NO_RELATIONS.  A new definition
                  landing in a swept module with no declaration FAILS the gate.
                  That is the point: the table is a commitment about a region of
                  the corpus, not a bag of examples.

  RELATIONS       fqn -> [relation, ...].  Each must hold on the fixed grid.

  NO_RELATIONS    fqn -> reason.  A definition in a swept module for which none
                  of the relation kinds applies.  Writing the reason down is the
                  work; it is what stops "no relations" from meaning "nobody
                  looked".

  EXPECTED_VIOLATIONS
                  (fqn, relation-id) -> reason.  A relation the definition
                  legitimately does NOT satisfy, pinned so that a silent change
                  of behaviour is caught in BOTH directions: if a pinned
                  violation starts holding, that is a regression too.  Same
                  discipline as the differential battery's expected
                  disagreements.

  NOT_EXTRACTABLE fqn -> reason.  In a swept module but `extract/api.py` cannot
                  build a callable, so no relation can be evaluated.  Recorded
                  rather than skipped, because a silently unevaluated definition
                  is the failure mode this whole directory exists to prevent.

HOW TO CHOOSE WHAT TO DECLARE NEXT, which matters more than it sounds.

Sweeping modules alphabetically and targeting weak verdicts are not two orders of
the same work.  Measured over six batches here: four alphabetical module sweeps
found ZERO gaps in this table's vocabulary; two batches targeted at definitions
whose verdict was FALSIFIED or absent found TWO.  The reason is structural rather
than lucky --

    a sweep finds definitions that fit the existing kinds, because "declarable"
    is defined by the kinds.  An instrument swept over the cases it can already
    express measures its own vocabulary, not the corpus.

So order by the weakness of the verdict: bodies still marked FALSIFIED first
(a relation there either survives a correction, which is evidence the correction
kept the right structure, or fails it, which is evidence it did not), then bodies
carrying no verdict at all, which nothing in the corpus can contradict today.

THE TWO KNOWN VOCABULARY GAPS, which are a specification for anyone extending
the kinds rather than a list of shortfalls:

  * REFLECTION ABOUT AN ANCHOR.  `|slope - 1|` is even about `slope = 1`; the
    negation kinds here reflect about zero.  A real family: calibration slope,
    `Ns` from an observed correlation, and most "distance from ideal" quantities.
    See `calibrationSlopeDeviation`.
  * SCALING OF THE LOGARITHM OF AN ARGUMENT.  `maxSafeEpistaticOrder` satisfies
    `f(N^c, q) = c · f(N, q)`; every kind here transforms arguments
    multiplicatively or by complement.

Neither is approximated with a nearby kind.  Declaring a plain `scales` for
either would assert something false, which is worse than declaring nothing.

UNSWEPT MODULES ARE VISIBLE DEBT, NOT ZERO.  `run.py --coverage` prints how many
extractable scalar definitions live outside SWEPT_MODULES.  Extending the sweep
is additive and never weakens an existing gate.  Do not add a module to
SWEPT_MODULES without declaring every definition in it.
