"""Coverage ledger for the population-genetics slice.

THE RULE
--------
Every definition in the slice is in exactly one of three states:

  COVERED      a check exists that compares it to an independent reference AND
               is demonstrated able to fail (mutation-tested, non-vacuous).
  UNREACHABLE  named reason why no reference can exist. An explicit, argued
               entry -- not a silence.
  UNACCOUNTED  neither. This number must go to zero; it is the only one that
               represents work not yet done.

A definition counted as COVERED because a check merely *runs* against it would
inflate the number without informing anyone, so coverage is taken from the
battery's own vacuity verdict rather than from the existence of a check.
