"""CALIBRATION of the differential battery's GATE, in both directions.

    python3 proofs/validation/empirical/differential/test_battery_gate.py

`test_identity_gate.py` and `test_roundtrip.py` calibrate two families of CHECK.
Nothing calibrated `run.py` itself -- the code that decides, from a table of
per-check results, whether the battery passed.  That code was calibrated in
practice at exactly one boundary: a check whose EVERY grid point raised was
reported.  A check evaluable at one of fifteen points was not, and neither was
an instrument that compared nothing at all.

Measured before the fix, driving the real `run.main()` with `checks.CHECKS`
perturbed:

    14/15 grid points raise, survivor at index 0   -> verdict AGREE, rc 0
    14/15 grid points raise, survivor at index 14  -> verdict AGREE, rc 0
    15/15 grid points raise                        -> verdict ERROR, rc 1
    extraction table emptied                       -> cross-check compared 0
                                                      definitions, totality
                                                      audit visited 0 points,
                                                      neither said so

So this asserts, over the REAL check list:

  NEGATIVE  the unperturbed battery returns 0, and a perturbation that leaves
            every point evaluable does not trip the new failure.
  POSITIVE  a check that loses part of its grid fails, whichever end survives;
            a check that loses all of it fails; an instrument that measured
            nothing fails.

The partial-grid probes are placed at BOTH ends of the victim's grid.  Several
checks in `checks.py` carry a `canfail_clause` saying in words that their
discrimination lives at one end of the grid -- `coalFst-exact-split`'s says the
check cannot discriminate at all for `t << Ne` -- so a probe that only ever
removed the head would certify the instrument over the half where the loss is
harmless.

Stdlib only, no Lean, no build; it does import the generated table through
`run.py`, so it runs after `emit.py` exactly as the battery does.
