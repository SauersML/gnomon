"""Family simulator: NEUTRAL ALLELE-FREQUENCY / SHARED-LD BENCHMARK.

The corpus's headline transport law. Target predictive accuracy is obtained
from source accuracy by a single scalar built from F_ST and shared LD:

    covarianceRetention = freqCorrFromFst(fst) * ldOverlapFromSharedLD(shared_ld)
                        = (1 - fst) * shared_ld

WHY THE JOINT SWEEP CANNOT FAIL, WHICH IS WHY THIS FILE IS SHAPED AS IT IS
  The retention is a PRODUCT of a frequency term and an LD term, and the corpus
  defines each by a separate one-line identity. A law wrong by a factor k in one
  term and 1/k in the other reproduces the product EXACTLY at every point of a
  joint sweep -- not approximately, exactly. A joint sweep is therefore not a
  weak test of this family, it is a test that CANNOT FAIL, and reporting
  agreement from one would be the textbook compensating-error result.

  Only two one-at-a-time sweeps can falsify it:

    A1  F_ST swept with SHARED LD PINNED  -- isolates freqCorrFromFst
    A2  SHARED LD swept with F_ST PINNED AT 0 -- isolates ldOverlapFromSharedLD

  C4 does not merely assert this. It CONSTRUCTS the compensating pair (k, 1/k),
  runs it through the joint arm and both split arms, and REQUIRES the joint arm
  to be fooled while both split arms reject. Claiming the joint sweep is
  insufficient without demonstrating it would be asking to be believed.

THE FINDING THIS FILE IS BUILT TO SETTLE: WHICH NORMALISATION IS shared_ld?
  `ldOverlapFromSharedLD` is the identity function, so the corpus never says
  what shared LD is measured in. There are two readings a reader can take, and
  THEY DIFFER BY EXACTLY THE FACTOR THE LAW IS MULTIPLYING BY:

    SLD_D   retention of the absolute LD coefficient D.
    SLD_R   retention of the correlation r = D / sqrt(p(1-p) q(1-q)).

  Under PURE DRIFT with no recombination, E[D_t] = D_0 (1 - 1/(2N_e))^t, so D
  decays at the same rate heterozygosity does. That means SLD_D already CONTAINS
  the drift factor, while SLD_R stays at 1 because numerator and denominator
  fall together. So on the pure-drift arm:

    if shared_ld means SLD_R:  prediction (1-F) * 1     = (1-F)   -- correct
    if shared_ld means SLD_D:  prediction (1-F) * (1-F) = (1-F)^2 -- DRIFT IS
                                                          COUNTED TWICE

  At F_ST = 0.3 those differ by 30%. This is not a stylistic ambiguity: one
  reading makes the headline law right and the other makes it wrong by a factor
  of (1-F_ST), and the corpus's identity function commits to neither. A1
  measures BOTH readings at every cell and C3 reports which one makes the law
  true. Same discipline as labelling the F_ST reading in
  fam_pgs_transport_drift.py, and for the same reason: an unlabelled convention
  that two consumers read differently is a defect with no error message.

BOTH FACTORS ARE DERIVED, NEVER RECEIVED
  Standing practice from the two previous families. The quantity the corpus and
  a reference could disagree about must be an OUTPUT of a process, not an input
  the simulator hands to the formula and reads back.

    F_ST       drift for t generations at N_e; measured off realised
               frequencies as a heterozygosity retention, ratio of sums.
    SHARED LD  recombination for T_LD generations at rate c; measured as the
               realised retention of D and of r. NOT set to (1-c)^t, and not
               read back from a parameter.

  THE TWO ARE MOVED BY PHYSICALLY SEPARATE KNOBS, which is what makes the split
  sweeps real rather than two parameterisations of one axis:
    A1 sets the recombination rate to EXACTLY ZERO -- only drift acts.
    A2 sets N_e very large but FINITE -- recombination dominates and F_ST stays
       at ~1e-4. Finite on purpose: an infinite population makes that arm
       deterministic, every replicate identical and the replicate scatter
       exactly zero, at which point a threshold in standard errors divides by
       nothing and reports the run's precision instead of the law's
       correctness. See NE_FROZEN and `agrees`.

CAN-FAIL
  F_ST must reach 0.15 and beyond, the human continental range. At F_ST = 0.01
  the predicted retention is 0.99 and (1-F), (1-F)^2 and exp(-F) agree to 1e-4,
  so a low-F_ST grid validates every candidate and decides nothing -- including
  the SLD_D versus SLD_R question above, which is invisible below F_ST ~ 0.05.
  The shared-LD axis must fall to ~0.6 or below for the same reason.

WHAT IS COVERED

  freqCorrFromFst                    A1, C3, C4
  ldOverlapFromSharedLD              A2, C3, C4
  covarianceRetention                C3, C4
  covarianceDivergenceFromRetention  C3
  neutralAFSharedLDBenchmarkRatio    C5
  neutralAFBenchmarkMetricProfile    C6
  targetBrierFromNeutralAFBenchmark  C6

  NOT MEASURED HERE, BY DESIGN AND NOT BY OMISSION:
  targetR2FromNeutralAFBenchmark. Its whole body is

      targetR2FromNeutralAFBenchmark V_A V_E fstTarget = presentDayR2 V_A V_E fstTarget

  so it IS presentDayR2 under another name, and presentDayR2 is measured by
  fam_pgs_transport_drift.py check C5. Measuring it again here would be ONE
  MEASUREMENT COUNTED TWICE and the agreement between the two families would
  read as corroboration while being nothing of the kind. This file CITES that
  result. C6 checks only that the FORWARDING still holds, which is a different
  claim from the quantity's correctness.

  NOT FOUND IN THE CORPUS: `targetGaussianAUCFromNeutralAFBenchmark` and
  `targetExactGaussianAUCFromNeutralAFBenchmark`, both listed for this family in
  families.py, have ZERO occurrences anywhere under proofs/ at the revision
  below. No replacement is guessed. THIS FAMILY IS THEREFORE NOT FULLY COVERED
  and this file does not claim it is.

THE AUC IN THIS FAMILY, NAMED
  neutralAFBenchmarkMetricProfile carries an `auc` field, so this family DOES
  touch an AUC and the estimand must be named:

      neutralAFBenchmarkMetricProfile = profileFromSignalVariance π V_E (...)
      profileFromSignalVariance.auc   = equalVarianceGaussianAUCFromSignalVariance

  It is a claim about equalVarianceGaussianAUCFromSignalVariance and NOT about
  liabilityThresholdAUCFromExplainedR2, which is a different estimand carrying a
  prevalence argument. Conflating the two has already cost this project an hour
  and produced a false alarm, so every AUC number here is labelled.

  A STRUCTURAL OBSERVATION C6 MEASURES: the profile TAKES a prevalence π, uses
  it in `brier`, and DOES NOT use it in `auc`. So profiles at π = 0.5 and
  π = 0.02 must return the SAME auc and DIFFERENT brier. DGP.lean states in its
  own text that AUC is not determined by second moments and that it offers this
  chart "as a numerical function only", with no theorem identifying it with a
  process AUC. fam_metrics measured a liability-threshold AUC moving from 0.833
  at π = 0.5 to 0.925 at π = 0.02. So if the deployed quantity does depend on
  prevalence, this field cannot be it at more than one prevalence. That is a
  SCOPE RESULT about where the chart may be used, not a refuted theorem, and C6
  records it as such.

    neutralAFBenchmarkMetricProfile takes π. Its `brier` field uses π; its `auc`

    prevalence-independent by construction. So:

      (a) the profile's auc must be IDENTICAL across the π grid while its brier
          MOVES -- a structural claim about the declaration, exact, no sampling;
      (b) targetBrierFromNeutralAFBenchmark must equal the profile's brier;

          still hold numerically.

    ESTIMAND, NAMED: equalVarianceGaussianAUCFromSignalVariance, NOT
    liabilityThresholdAUCFromExplainedR2.

    WHAT IS AND IS NOT TESTED. DGP.lean states that AUC is not determined by
    second moments and that it exposes this chart "as a numerical function
    only", with no theorem identifying it with a process AUC. The
    prevalence-independence measured here is a property of the CHART. fam_metrics
    measured a liability-threshold AUC moving 0.833 -> 0.925 across prevalence,
    so if the deployed quantity depends on prevalence this field cannot be it at
    more than one prevalence. SCOPE RESULT, not a refuted theorem.
