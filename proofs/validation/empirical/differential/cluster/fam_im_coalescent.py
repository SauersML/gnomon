"""Family simulator: ISOLATION WITH MIGRATION, TWO-DEME STRUCTURED COALESCENT.

WHY THIS FAMILY WAS WRITTEN FIRST
  It is the cheapest of the five unsimulated families AND the one most likely
  to return a result rather than a green tick. Those are not independent
  virtues: a first simulator that can only agree teaches us nothing about
  whether the harness works, and this repository has already shipped
  instruments that returned credible numbers while measuring nothing. This one
  has a disagreement waiting for it before a single replicate is drawn.

THE DISAGREEMENT THAT MAKES IT WORTH THE NODE TIME
  The corpus says the equilibrium mean coalescence time for two lineages in
  DIFFERENT demes is

      twoDemeIMEquilibriumETst M = (2M + 1)/M   =  2 + 1/M

  The specification for this family in differential/cluster/families.py cites
  Wakeley and states the reference as 2 + 2/M. Those differ by a factor of two
  in the migration arm, which is the signature of a per-lineage versus total
  migration-rate convention, and NOTHING IN THE REPOSITORY CHECKS IT. One of
  the two is wrong.

  So this simulator is built so that ONE NUMBER DECIDES. Define

      kappa(M) := (E[T_st] - 2) * M          [T in units of 2N generations]

  The corpus predicts kappa = 1 at every M. The Wakeley form as quoted in
  families.py predicts kappa = 2 at every M. C2 measures kappa. Whichever side
  loses is named in the output as a string, not left as "a discrepancy" for a
  reader to adjudicate.

  THE CONVENTION IS TAKEN OUT OF MY HANDS ON PURPOSE. Neither M nor a
  coalescent time unit is a primitive here. The primitives are PHYSICAL: N
  diploids per deme and a per-lineage per-generation migration probability m.
  M = 4*N*m and the time unit 2N generations are DERIVED from those. A
  simulator that took M as an input would be assuming exactly the convention
  the run is supposed to settle, and would return whichever answer its author
  had already assumed.

  THE CORPUS STATES ITS CONVENTION EXPLICITLY, which is why this is decidable
  rather than a matter of taste. The docstring on twoDemeIMFirstStepSame says:

      "Time is in units of 2 Nₑ generations, so two lineages sitting in one
       deme coalesce at rate 1 and each lineage leaves its deme at rate M/2."

  and the docstring on twoDemeIMFirstStepDiff says the only event from the
  different-deme state is "a migration, at total rate M". So the corpus has
  written down exactly the rates this sampler derives from N and m. If the
  measurement lands on kappa = 1, the corpus is right and the families.py spec
  is quoting a reference that does not describe these rates. If it lands on
  kappa = 2, the corpus's stated rates do not follow from its own primitives.
  Neither outcome is a matter of naming.

  EVERY DECLARATION IN THIS FAMILY CARRIES "Empirical status: UNTESTED" in the
  corpus. This is the first instrument to touch any of them.

TWO ENGINES THAT SHARE NO CODE
  ENGINE A, sampler. Continuous-time competing exponential clocks on the
    two-lineage state space {SAME deme, DIFFERENT demes}, vectorised over
    replicates. Draws times.
  ENGINE B, exact solve. The DISCRETE-generation ancestral chain written as a
    2x2 linear system in (E[T_S], E[T_D]) and solved with numpy.linalg.solve.
    Draws nothing.
  They agree only if both are right. Two engines that disagree is the most
  productive thing that can happen here, so they are kept separate rather than
  refactored into a shared helper.

THE CONTROL THAT PINS THE CLOCK WITHOUT TOUCHING THE DISPUTE
  E[T_ss] = 2 holds at EVERY M, and -- this is the point -- it holds under
  BOTH candidate migration conventions. The corpus names this Strobeck's
  invariance and calls its M-freedom "the content of the model", so C1 is
  simultaneously a control on my sampler and a corpus claim under test; both
  readings are reported. Substituting the corpus's own
  first-step equations gives E[T_ss] = 2 whether the per-lineage migration rate
  is M/2 or M; the migration terms cancel. So C1 is a genuine control: it
  proves the coalescence clock and the sampler are right, and it is
  CONSTITUTIONALLY INCAPABLE of deciding C2. A control that could decide the
  test would not be a control.

  This is also why C6 exists. A sampler whose migration rate is wrong by a
  factor of two passes C1 unharmed. C6 runs exactly that corrupted sampler and
  requires C2 to reject it. A check never shown failing is not a check.

CAN-FAIL
  The M grid runs from 0.1 to 8. At M = 8 the two candidate forms are 2.125
  and 2.25, six percent apart and inside reach of the error bars; at M = 0.1
  they are 12 and 22. A grid confined to large M would leave the two candidates
  within a few percent of each other and would decide nothing, which is the
  failure mode this family has survived in so far.

WHAT IS COVERED
  All eight members of the family are LIVE in the corpus at the revision below
  and every one is exercised:

      twoDemeIMFirstStepSame          C3
      twoDemeIMFirstStepDiff          C3
      twoDemeIMEquilibriumETss        C1
      twoDemeIMEquilibriumETst        C2   <- the deciding one
      twoDemeIMEquilibriumScalars     C4
      twoDemeIMEquilibriumDelta       C4
      DemographicCoalescenceScalars.delta   C4
      expectedSqMeanPGSDiff_IMEquilibrium   C4, REPORTED NOT SCORED (below)

  NO MEMBER OF THIS FAMILY IS MISSING FROM THE CORPUS. That is worth saying
  explicitly, because it is not true of the neighbouring families: eleven
  members listed for the other five unsimulated families could not be found in
  the corpus at any name, and this one is clean.

  `delta` is a SHORT NAME and short names collide in this corpus. The
  declaration transcribed here is `DemographicCoalescenceScalars.delta` in
  Calibrator/PortabilityDrift.lean, reached through
  `twoDemeIMEquilibriumScalars`. If a `delta` elsewhere in the corpus is meant,
  this simulator does not cover it.

WHAT IS REPORTED AND NOT SCORED, AND WHY
  expectedSqMeanPGSDiff_IMEquilibrium feeds `2 * delta` into `Var_Delta_Mu` as
  an F_ST. C4 measures that the coalescent delta is Hudson's F_ST between the
  two demes and reports the doubling, because `Var_Delta_Mu V_A fst` is scored
  against a simulated polygenic score in the pgs_transport_drift family, not
  here. Scoring it here would mean this file quietly re-measuring another
  family's estimand and the agreement reading as corroboration. It is left as
  a measured input to that family with its error bar attached.

NO AUC IS TOUCHED BY THIS FAMILY. Recorded because two AUC estimands in this
  corpus -- liabilityThresholdAUCFromExplainedR2 and
  equalVarianceGaussianAUCFromSignalVariance -- look alike, are different, and
  conflating them has already cost an hour and produced a false alarm. Neither
  appears anywhere downstream of the eight members above.

TRANSCRIPTION PROVENANCE
  Every corpus body below is quoted beside its Python transcription with its
  file and declaration name and NO LINE NUMBER, because line numbers here go
  stale and have already sent one instrument chasing declarations that no
  longer existed.

  Transcribed against revision a4bc5385. The eight bodies were re-read from
  the working tree at three successive revisions while this file was being
  written -- 48ff8c05, 9eee6e05, a4bc5385 -- and were byte-identical at all
  three. Calibrator/PortabilityDrift.lean was being edited by other sessions
  throughout, and one read of it failed outright because the file was mid-write
  at that instant, so the agreement across three revisions is the evidence
  here, not any single read. If this file is being read at a later revision,
  re-read the eight declarations before trusting the transcription.

RUNNING IT -- NOT ON A LOGIN NODE
  Nothing here needs msprime, scipy or a build. numpy only, Python 3.6
  compatible, single-threaded by construction. The thread pins are still set,
  because numpy will otherwise take every core and one agent's contention gets
  misdiagnosed as another's deadlock.

      srun --time=30 --mem=8G --cpus-per-task=1 \
        env OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 \
        python3 proofs/validation/empirical/differential/cluster/fam_im_coalescent.py \

  CAPTURE BOTH STREAMS. A nonzero exit from this script is a MEASUREMENT
  OUTCOME, not a crash: the report goes to stdout and the failing check names
  go to stderr. A harness that collects only stderr has already recorded a
  family of this shape as crashing.

  Output goes OUTSIDE /tmp, which is node-local and invisible to the next relay
  call, and carries a unique name so an absent file means not written rather
  than not written here.

  README rule, compare do not overwrite: this family has no stored result yet,
  so the first run creates one. Every run after that goes to a fresh path and
  gets diffed. A disagreement between two runs is a finding and needs both
  numbers and both revisions.

           C2 can fail, which is the only thing that makes C2's agreement in
           the uncorrupted arm mean anything.

    If (i) fails the corruption was not the one described. If (ii) fails, C2 is
    insensitive to exactly the quantity it was built to measure and NOTHING
