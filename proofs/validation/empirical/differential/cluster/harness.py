"""Run a simulation family end to end, and land a result nobody has to
hand-verify.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Hand-verification is the binding constraint on running thirty
families -- not CPU and not memory. Every rule enforced below is here because
this project lost time to the exact failure it prevents, and every one of them
is recorded in the validation README with its instance:

  1.  BOTH STREAMS, CAPTURED SEPARATELY. A 25-second probe harness collected
      stderr only. A family that reports a failed check on STDOUT and exits
      nonzero was recorded as CRASHING. It had run fine. So this harness keeps
      the two streams in two files, and treats the exit code as DATA: a nonzero
      exit is a measurement outcome, never a failure by itself. The only things
      that make THIS script exit nonzero are its own inability to do its job.

  2.  PROVENANCE, OR NO RECORD. Revision, working-tree cleanliness, the dirty
      paths, timestamp, host, interpreter. `simprov.stamp` already writes those
      with the same field names as `Shared.Results.write` on the Lean side, so
      it is used rather than reimplemented. A results file that cannot name the
      revision it describes is a number, not a measurement -- so if the stamp
      cannot name a revision, this script refuses to run at all rather than
      recording an unattributable result.

  3.  DIFF, NEVER OVERWRITE. A stored result is the only cross-check that
      exists, and the case where it is worth most is exactly the case where the
      script that produced it no longer runs. The fresh run goes to a new path
      and is compared. Several families here write to `os.path.join(HERE, ...)`
      and would clobber their own stored result: those writes are detected and
      UNDONE from a pre-run content-addressed snapshot, with the restoration
      verified by hash.

      The comparison reports STRUCTURAL differences (a key in one and not the
      other, a list whose length changed, a type change, a boolean flip)
      SEPARATELY from numeric ones, because they mean different things. For
      numeric it reports the worst absolute difference, the worst relative
      difference, and the count of differing leaves. Two families were
      confirmed this way at worst relative differences of 1.8e-14 and 3.3e-13,
      which is floating-point reduction order rather than disagreement -- a
      distinction that exists only if it is measured instead of eyeballed.

  4.  VERIFY THAT THE WORK HAPPENED. A `sed` that matched nothing exited 0 and
      produced a byte-identical script that would have measured the wrong tree.
      So every transformation here checks its own effect: a copy is re-hashed,
      a restore is re-hashed against the snapshot, and the fresh results file is
      proved to be a DIFFERENT FILE from the baseline before anything is
      compared -- otherwise a family that wrote nothing would have its baseline
      diffed against itself and reported as agreeing perfectly.

  5.  VERDICT FIRST, LOG SECOND. A real guard finding sat unread at the bottom
      of a long advisory list for hours. A finding that is not surfaced is
      functionally invisible. Every summary this writes puts the verdict at the
      top, and SUMMARY.txt is rewritten after EACH family, so a crash on family
      seven still leaves a readable verdict for families one to six.

  6.  THE INTERPRETER IS A PARAMETER. The cluster default `python3` is 3.6.8
      and cannot run modern code; a guard died on a SyntaxError and its nonzero
      exit was indistinguishable from a finding for an entire build. The family
      interpreter is taken as an argument, verified by running it before any
      family is launched, and a bad one is a loud refusal (exit 4) rather than
      a silent fallback.

  7.  NO PATH IS INFERRED BY COUNTING PARENTS. The repository root is the
      directory containing `.git`, found by walking up. The output directory is
      an argument. `parents[2]` survived a directory move by evaluating to a
      real but wrong path, twice in one day, and that is the worst available
      outcome.

WHAT IT WRITES.  Under `--out DIR`:

    SUMMARY.txt              verdict-first, rewritten after every family
    index.jsonl              one summary object per line, appended and flushed
    _vault/<sha256>          content-addressed snapshots of clobbered baselines
    <family>/summary.json    the harness summary object for that family
    <family>/stdout.txt      the family's stdout, complete
    <family>/stderr.txt      the family's stderr, complete
    <family>/<name>.json     the family's OWN results file, relocated here

The family's own results file keeps the schema the family already emits. This
script imposes nothing on it; it only reads `READ_THE_TEST` and `failed_checks`
if they happen to be there, because the families that have them are the ones
whose verdict is worth surfacing.

KEPT TO PYTHON 3.6. This runs on the cluster, and pinning the FAMILY
interpreter is no help if the pin itself will not parse under the ambient one.
No f-strings with `=`, no walrus, no `from __future__ import annotations`, no
`subprocess.run(capture_output=)`, no dataclasses.
