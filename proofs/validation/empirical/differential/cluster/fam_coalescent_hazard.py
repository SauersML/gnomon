"""Family simulator: COALESCENT HAZARD, AND THE HARMONIC-MEAN BRIDGE.

READ THIS FIRST -- THREE OF THE SIX MEMBERS CANNOT BE FALSIFIED.

  integratedCoalescentHazard      Lambda(t) = integral of hazard over [0,t]
  coalescenceSurvivalFromHazard   S(t) = exp(-Lambda(t))
  coalescenceCdfFromHazard        F(t) = 1 - S(t)

  These three are the DEFINITION of a survival function from a hazard. They
  are not claims about a population; they are the chain rule and the
  fundamental theorem of calculus wearing population-genetic names. A
  simulator that draws times by inverse-transform on Lambda and then
  "confirms" S = exp(-Lambda) has measured its own integrator and its own
  inverse-transform sampler, and NOTHING ELSE. It cannot come out any other
  way.

  A prior analysis of this family reached exactly this conclusion, and it is
  written here, beside the checks, and into the results file so that it
  cannot be quietly lost the next time someone reads a green C0 as evidence.

  C0 below does exercise those three declarations. Its verdict is scored into
  the INSTRUMENT health flag and is EXCLUDED BY NAME from the corpus findings.
  Agreement in C0 is a statement about this file's quadrature. It is not
  evidence for the corpus, and the results file says so in a field rather than
  in a comment.

WHAT IS ACTUALLY FALSIFIABLE HERE, AND IT IS THE BRIDGE.

  The corpus expresses a time-varying population size TWICE, in two different
  languages, and never checks that the two readings agree.

    (1) As a PROCESS. Calibrator/PortabilityDrift.lean defines survival from an
        integrated hazard: with Ne(t) varying, the hazard is 1/(2 Ne(t)) and
        Lambda(t) = integral of it. Nothing is averaged.

    (2) As a NUMBER. Calibrator/LDDecayTheory.lean defines

            harmonicMeanNe (Ne : Fin T -> R) := T / (sum of 1 / Ne i)

        and the drift-retention work throughout the corpus uses that single
        harmonic mean in place of the trajectory. `bottleneck_dominates_harmonic_mean`
        and `harmonicMeanNe_lt_timeWeightedArithmeticMeanNe` (Calibrator/DGP.lean)
        are the corpus's own statements that a bottleneck pulls it down.

  THE QUESTION THIS FILE ASKS. Does the constant-size population of size
  Ne_h = harmonicMeanNe(Ne) have the SAME TMRCA DISTRIBUTION as the true
  time-varying history? That is the bridge, and it is the only claim in this
  family that a simulation can contradict.

  WHY THE MEAN CANNOT DECIDE IT. The harmonic mean is constructed so that the
  two integrated hazards MEET at the window endpoint:

        Lambda_true(T_w) = sum over g < T_w of 1/(2 Ne(g))
                         = T_w / (2 Ne_h)
                         = Lambda_surrogate(T_w)

  identically, by the definition of Ne_h. So the two survival curves are
  PINNED TOGETHER at t = T_w whatever the history is, and the total
  coalescence probability over the window is right by construction. A summary
  statistic dominated by that agreement -- and the mean is close to one --
  validates the surrogate on a history where the two curves cross. That is
  why the check below is DISTRIBUTIONAL: pointwise survival with batch error
  bars, and quantiles from the 10th to the 90th percentile.

  THE BLIND POINT IS REPORTED AND NOT SCORED. t = T_w is the one time at which
  the bridge check is CONSTITUTIONALLY INCAPABLE of disagreeing. It is
  computed, printed and stored so a reader can see the pinning happen, and it
  is excluded from the scored grid. A bridge check evaluated only at the
  horizon would decide nothing and would look like a pass.

  THE MEAN IS MEASURED ANYWAY, AND LABELLED. Whether E[T] also agrees is
  itself a measurement -- the pinning argument above pins S(T_w), not the
  integral of S -- so the mean comparison is reported alongside the
  distributional one and explicitly marked as the near-blind statistic. If the
  distribution differs while the mean does not, that is the whole thesis of
  this file, measured rather than asserted.

  DERIVED, NOT ACCEPTED. Ne_h is never an input. The primitives are a CENSUS
  TRAJECTORY of diploid counts. Engine A draws parents from the gene-copy pool
  and lets collisions happen; the per-generation coalescence probability is
  MEASURED from those collisions in a separate census pass with its own error
  bar; the measured probabilities are inverted to Ne_hat(g) = 1/(2 p_hat(g));
  and Ne_h is `harmonicMeanNe` applied to THAT. Nowhere is the number 1/(2N)
  asserted. A simulator handed the harmonic mean it was built to test would
  agree with itself, look rigorous, and measure nothing -- this project spent
  a day on instruments of exactly that shape.

  THE WINDOW IS PART OF THE CLAIM. `harmonicMeanNe` takes `Ne : Fin T -> R`,
  so Ne_h depends on the window T_w over which the trajectory is averaged, and
  for a bottleneck it depends on it strongly. The corpus never says which T_w.
  C3 sweeps T_w and reports the spread as a finding in its own right; the
  SCORED cell is the full history, named in the output.

ALSO FALSIFIABLE, AND CHECKED SEPARATELY.

  C4  discreteRecombinationSurvival (1-r)^tmrca and twoLocusIBDCovariance
      w * (1-r)^tmrca, against a two-locus lineage walked back generation by
      generation with an explicit per-generation recombination event. The
      ibdWeight w is MEASURED at r = 0 and then used to predict the r > 0
      cells, so the formula is not handed its own answer.

  C5  the hard 1 on the diagonal of twoLocusCoalescentCovarianceMatrix, tested
      against SAMPLED GENOTYPES rather than assumed. That entry asserts both
      loci are variance-standardised. Raw diploid dosages have variance
      2p(1-p), which cannot reach 1 at any allele frequency, so the claim is
      decidable against a real genotype sample and the run says which way it
      went. The zeros away from the linked pair are tested too, using two
      unlinked loci in the same block.

WHAT THE FAMILY LISTING NAMES THAT THIS FILE DOES NOT COVER AS A MEMBER.
  differential/cluster/families.py lists `twoLocusIdx0` and `twoLocusIdx1`
  alongside the six. Both are `private def` in Calibrator/DGP.lean and return
  `Fin t`, not a number. They are exercised only through the matrix: C5's
  off-block zeros are what would fail if those indices named the wrong
  positions. They are reported as COVERED INDIRECTLY, not as scored members,
  because a private index constructor has no independent empirical content.

  ALL SIX MEMBERS NAMED FOR THIS FAMILY ARE LIVE IN THE CORPUS. Nothing was
  missing and nothing was guessed at. The three that are live but
  unfalsifiable are unfalsifiable by their content, not by their absence.

TWO ENGINES THAT SHARE NO CODE, AND WHERE THEY MUST DISAGREE.
  ENGINE A, WRIGHT-FISHER. Discrete generations. Each surviving lineage pair
    draws two parent indices uniformly from the 2N gene copies of that
    generation and coalesces on a collision. No hazard, no exponential, no
    integral appears in it. It is the primitive process.
  ENGINE B, INTEGRATED HAZARD. Continuous time. Builds Lambda by accumulating
    the piecewise-constant hazard and inverts it on an Exp(1) draw. It is the
    corpus's own reading, and it draws nothing that Engine A draws.

  THEY ARE EXPECTED TO DISAGREE, and by a stated amount: Engine A's waiting
  time is geometric, Engine B's is exponential, and the two differ at
  O(1/(2N)) in relative terms plus a half-generation offset in the survival
  curve. At N = 500 that is 0.1 percent. A check that demanded equality to
  many digits would be measuring the discretisation, so the A-vs-B comparison
  in C0b quotes the expected gap 1/(2N) BEFORE the measurement and fails only
  outside a stated multiple of it.

  THE BRIDGE IS MEASURED WITHIN EACH ENGINE, never across them. True history
  and harmonic surrogate are both drawn by Engine A, and both by Engine B, so
  the discretisation cancels out of the difference. The two engines must agree
  on the FINDING; they are not required to agree on the numbers to a precision
  the discretisation forbids.

POSITIVE CONTROL THAT MUST FAIL IN TWO DIRECTIONS.
  C6 displaces the population history by C6_SHIFT generations, through the
  IDENTICAL code path both engines already use (`shift_history`, whose shift
  is 0 in every other arm). That is an endpoint-convention error in the
  integration of a step function, which is the failure the family's own spec
  names.

    (i)  C1 MUST STAY BLIND. A constant history is invariant under the shift,
         so the constant-hazard mean is unchanged. This is not a courtesy: it
         demonstrates that an arm resting on the textbook constant-hazard
         result would certify a sampler whose step function is fifty
         generations out of place.
    (ii) C2 MUST FIRE. The zero-hazard window lands C6_SHIFT generations away
         from where the history declares it, so coalescence events appear
         inside an interval where the hazard is zero. C2 counts them; the
         count is an integer and must be zero uncorrupted and nonzero here.

  BOTH ARE REQUIRED. If (i) moves, the corruption was not the one described
  and the control has proved nothing. If (ii) does not fire, C2 is blind to
  the exact error it exists to catch and nothing in this file should be
  believed. C3's response to the same corruption is reported as a third
  direction and is NOT scored, because C3 is expected to move under the
  uncorrupted history too.

INSTRUMENT VERDICT AND CORPUS FINDINGS ARE SEPARATE, AND THE EXIT CODE
FOLLOWS THE INSTRUMENT.
  READ_THE_TEST is the INSTRUMENT health flag: C0, C1, C2 and C6. Those are
  the checks that can only fail because this file is broken.
  CORPUS_FINDINGS carries C3, C4 and C5 as verdict STRINGS naming which side
  lost. A corpus disagreement is a RESULT. It must not flip the harness pass
  flag, because a harness that goes red when the corpus is wrong trains its
  reader to fix the harness.

REPLICATE UNIT: THE BATCH. One record per batch, and every standard error in
  this file is the scatter ACROSS batches. A per-draw error bar would be an
  analytic claim about the estimator rather than a measurement of it.

EVERY NUMBER IS LABELLED WITH ITS ESTIMAND. Confusing two similar quantities
  cost this project an hour today. `E[T]` here is always TMRCA IN GENERATIONS
  for a pair of lineages under the named history; it is never in coalescent
  units, never a per-locus quantity, and never the between-population
  divergence time. `Ne_h` is always harmonicMeanNe over the named window T_w,
  never a census size and never an equilibrium Ne.

TRANSCRIPTION PROVENANCE
  Bodies are quoted beside their transcriptions with file and DECLARATION
  NAME and NO LINE NUMBER. Line numbers in this corpus drifted measurably
  inside one hour today and have already sent one instrument chasing
  declarations that had moved.

  Declarations read from Calibrator/PortabilityDrift.lean
  (integratedCoalescentHazard, coalescenceSurvivalFromHazard,
  coalescenceCdfFromHazard), Calibrator/DGP.lean
  (discreteRecombinationSurvival, twoLocusIBDCovariance,
  twoLocusCoalescentCovarianceMatrix, twoLocusIdx0, twoLocusIdx1) and
  Calibrator/LDDecayTheory.lean (harmonicMeanNe). Three of those files carried
  uncommitted edits from other sessions at transcription time; re-read them
  before trusting this transcription at a later revision.

RUNNING IT -- NOT ON A LOGIN NODE
  numpy only, Python 3.6 compatible, single-threaded by construction. The
  thread pins are set because numpy will otherwise take every core and one
  agent's contention gets misdiagnosed as another's deadlock.

      srun --time=60 --mem=8G --cpus-per-task=1 \
        env OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 \

  CAPTURE BOTH STREAMS. A nonzero exit is a MEASUREMENT OUTCOME, not a crash:
  the report goes to stdout and the failing check names go to stderr. A probe
  harness that collected only stderr has already recorded a family of this
  shape as crashing.

  Output goes OUTSIDE /tmp, which is node-local and invisible to the next
  relay call, and carries a unique name so an absent file means not written
  rather than not written here.

  README rule, compare do not overwrite: this family has no stored result yet,
  so the first run creates one. Every run after that goes to a fresh path and
  gets diffed. A disagreement between two runs is a finding and needs both
  numbers and both revisions.

    THE CLAIM UNDER TEST, stated so it can lose: the constant-size population
    of size Ne_h = harmonicMeanNe(measured Ne trajectory) has the SAME TMRCA
    DISTRIBUTION as the true bottleneck history.

    THE STATISTIC IS DISTRIBUTIONAL AND IT HAS TO BE. The harmonic mean pins
    Lambda_true(T_w) = Lambda_surrogate(T_w) identically, so the survival
    curves CROSS at the window endpoint by construction and a summary
    statistic dominated by that agreement cannot separate them. Scored:
      quantiles from the 10th to the 90th percentile, per batch;
      the survival curve compared POINTWISE at a grid of times, per batch.
    Reported and NOT scored:
      t = T_w, the constitutionally blind point, printed so the pinning is
        visible rather than argued;
      E[TMRCA], the near-blind statistic, so a reader can see for themselves
        whether a mean-only comparison would have decided anything.

    Ne_h IS DERIVED. It comes from `corpus_harmonic_mean_ne_from_reciprocals`
    applied to the MEASURED 1/Ne trajectory, whose per-generation values came
    out of the census pass's parent-collision counts. The census sizes that
    built the history are printed beside it, and if the two disagree that is a
    fact about the census pass, not an input to the check.

    THE WINDOW IS SWEPT. `harmonicMeanNe` takes Ne over Fin T and the corpus
    never says which T. Ne_h is reported at every T_w in TW_GRID; the SCORED
    cell is the full history, named in the output. That the surrogate's answer
    depends on the window is a finding in its own right and is recorded as
    one.

    BOTH ENGINES RUN THE COMPARISON, each against its own surrogate, so the
    Wright-Fisher discretisation cancels out of the difference. The engines
    must agree on the FINDING; they are not required to agree on the numbers
    to a precision the discretisation forbids.

    THIS IS A CORPUS FINDING, NOT AN INSTRUMENT CHECK. Its verdict does not

    separated. The measured survival probability after tmrca generations is
    compared to (1-r)^tmrca.

    THE ibdWeight IS MEASURED, NOT SUPPLIED. twoLocusIBDCovariance is
    w * (1-r)^tmrca, and handing it w would leave only the exponent under
    test. So w is measured in the r = 0 cell -- where the survival factor is
    exactly 1, so the measured covariance IS w -- and the measured w then
    predicts every r > 0 cell.

    r = 0 IS THEREFORE A CALIBRATION CELL AND NOT A TEST. It is marked as such
    in the output. Reporting it as a passing check would be reporting that a
    number equals itself.

    twoLocusCoalescentCovarianceMatrix writes 1 on every diagonal entry. That
    is not a free choice: it ASSERTS that both loci are variance-standardised.
    A real genotype sample can contradict it, so this check builds one rather
    than assuming the assertion.

    THREE THINGS ARE MEASURED, and they are not the same claim:

      (a) RAW DIPLOID DOSAGES. Var(g) = 2p(1-p), which is at most 0.5 and
          reaches it only at p = 0.5. So the diagonal of the raw sample
          covariance CANNOT be 1 at any allele frequency. This is FALSIFIABLE
          and is expected to REFUTE the diagonal for raw dosages; the run says
          which way it went and by how much, across an allele-frequency grid.

      (b) STANDARDISED DOSAGES. The diagonal is then 1 BY CONSTRUCTION. This
          is measured and reported, and it is EXPLICITLY MARKED AS BLIND: a
          quantity divided by its own standard deviation has unit variance
          whatever the corpus says. Reporting (b) as a pass for the corpus
          would be the exact error this file's header warns about, so it is
          scored as an instrument sanity line and named as non-falsifiable.

      (c) THE OFF-DIAGONAL, on standardised dosages, against
          twoLocusIBDCovariance with the ibdWeight MEASURED in C4. This is
          falsifiable and is the entry that carries content.

      (d) THE ZEROS AWAY FROM THE LINKED PAIR. Two extra unlinked loci are
          sampled into the same block and their entries are compared to 0.
          This is where twoLocusIdx0 and twoLocusIdx1 would show up if they
          named the wrong positions: a matrix whose linked pair sat at (2,3)
          would put the measured covariance where this check demands a zero.

    not touch READ_THE_TEST.
