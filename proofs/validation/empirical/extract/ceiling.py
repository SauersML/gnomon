"""Where does mechanical extraction actually top out?

A definition can fail to become callable for two very different reasons:

  INTRINSIC   its own body is outside real arithmetic -- an integral, a Finset
              sum, a matrix literal, a quantifier.  No amount of translator work
              helps; it needs a different kind of model.
  INHERITED   its own body is fine, but it calls something that is blocked.
              These collapse for free the moment their blocker is fixed.

Conflating the two makes the ceiling look lower than it is and makes translator
work look less valuable than it is.  This script separates them, propagates the
blockage through the call graph, and reports the ceiling: how many definitions
would be callable if every INHERITED blockage were resolved, and which root
blockers are load-bearing for the most dependents.
