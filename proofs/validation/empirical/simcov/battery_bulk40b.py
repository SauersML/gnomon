"""Battery 40b: the four cells of battery 40 whose GATES failed, redone.

Battery 40 produced four results its own gates would not certify, and this file
fixes the designs rather than the write-ups:

  A `averageEffect`. The control was "set the dominance to zero and the slope
    must be a", and with `d = 0` the genotypic value is EXACTLY linear in
    dosage, so least squares returns `a` to machine precision. `verdict.py`
    correctly refused it as degenerate -- a control that cannot fail gates
    nothing -- and the competitors were downgraded to LEAD. The control here is
    the sampler's own mean dosage against `2p`, which carries sampling noise
    and would fail if the Hardy-Weinberg draw were wrong.

  C `effectiveGeneticEffect`. Both competitors were CONSTANT across the design
    (`bG`, `bG + bGxE`), so the harness reported NO POWER: a prediction that
    does not move cannot be said to have been rejected by a design that moves.
    A competitor that moves with `E_mean` is added -- the reading that takes the
    environment's second moment as well as its mean.

  E `effectiveFisherInformation`. Battery 40 read FALSIFIED at 3.2 sems and 7%,
    just past both gates, on n = 600 individuals per study. The estimator there
    is a RATIO (slope times variance over covariance) and a ratio is biased at
    order 1/n, so 7% at n = 600 is the estimator and not the definition. n is
    raised and swept, and the residual is reported AGAINST n: a bias that
    shrinks like 1/n is the estimator's, a bias that does not is the body's.
    That is a discrimination battery 40 could not make.

  F `multiAncestryEffectiveN`. Battery 40 rejected the body AND all three
    competitors, which is the signature of a broken observable rather than four
    wrong formulas. The MSE-equivalence inversion is dropped for a direct
    reading: the posterior precision of the target effect, minus the prior
    precision, which is the sample size the data contributed. That quantity is
    what "effective sample size" has to mean if it is to be compared with n1
    and n2 at all, and it is stated here rather than left implicit.
