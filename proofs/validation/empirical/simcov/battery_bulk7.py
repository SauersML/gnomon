"""Battery 20: tagging heritability redone, selected drift, enrichment by fit.

Two of these are redesigns of comparisons the previous batteries got wrong, and
the redesign is the point in each case.

  gwasHeritability -- battery 18 compared against the NOMINAL h2 while the
      realised sum of squared effects at sixty loci has a standard deviation of
      about 0.09, so the run whose nominal h2 was 0.5 had a realised 0.41 and
      the apparent 42-sem gap was the difference between those two numbers.
      Here the comparison is against the realised effect mass on the same draw,
      with the loci raised to 400 so the two differ by less than a percent.

  heritabilityEnrichment -- battery 14 drew effects with the variances the
      definition states and then measured their mean square, which tests the
      random number generator. Here the oracle is a FIT: two SNP categories are
      simulated, a phenotype is built, and the per-SNP variance explained is
      recovered by regression in each category separately. Nothing in that path
      is generated from the enrichment formula.

`selectedDriftFactor` and `fstFromDriftFactor` are new: the first is a
per-generation retention with a selection correction, the second its complement.
