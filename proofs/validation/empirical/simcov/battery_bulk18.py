"""Battery 33: a deme-count sweep, a recombination rate, and six architecture scalars.

  fstDriftMigration = 1/(1 + bigM) -- the same shape as the definition this
      branch already renamed for being deme-count blind, and with the same
      inability to say so: it reads `bigM = 4 Ne m` and nothing else. The design
      is therefore the one that exposed the earlier case -- hold `4 Ne m` FIXED
      and sweep the number of demes -- because a formula in `bigM` alone must
      return one number for every deme count, and the island model does not.
      `F_ST` is read as `1 - E[T_within]/E[T_between]` from coalescence times,
      so no estimator convention enters and no mutation model is needed.

  ldBreakageRate = 2 r -- the rate at which recombination separates the two loci
      of a sampled PAIR of lineages. The two is the pair, exactly as in
      `mutationSharedRetentionAt`: either lineage recombining decouples the
      loci, so the pair survives `t` generations intact with probability
      `(1-r)^(2t)`. The competing one-lineage reading is carried alongside.

  Six architecture scalars, each against a realisation rather than against its
  own algebra: spikeAndSlabVariance against the sample variance of draws from
  the mixture it describes; effectGeneticCorrelation against the realised
  uncentred correlation of two effect vectors at known overlap;
  additiveHeritability against the realised variance ratio;
  expectedSquaredEffect, meanAbsoluteEffect and heritabilityEnrichment against
  their realisations under a simulated architecture.

  For the last three the honest note is that they are close to definitional --
  what a measurement can catch is a wrong normalisation or a wrong power, not a
  wrong concept -- so each is fed a design where the obvious wrong variants
  (dividing by the wrong count, squaring instead of absolute value) give
  numerically different answers, and those variants are carried as competitors.
