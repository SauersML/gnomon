"""Verdict gates: make the harness refuse the errors it has actually made.

Across twelve batteries this harness produced roughly a dozen wrong verdicts. All
of them fell into a small number of repeatable shapes, and every one was caught
by a human noticing rather than by the harness objecting. That is the wrong place
for the check to live, so the shapes are encoded here.

FALSE POSITIVES -- a defect reported where none exists:

  BROKEN DESIGN. The asymmetric-migration cells reported 1458 sems against a
      design whose SYMMETRIC cell disagreed with an already-validated oracle.
      A battery that cannot reproduce a known result has no standing to report a
      new one, so `control=` is now mandatory for any falsification: a cell whose
      answer is independently known, run on the same code path. If the control
      misses, every verdict in that record is VOID rather than FALSIFIED.

  ASSUMED ERROR BARS. Two equilibria showed "100+ sems" from a plateau sampled at
      successive generations, which are autocorrelated, so the standard error was
      understated by the square root of the correlation time. `sem_source` must
      now be declared; anything but independent replicates downgrades a
      falsification to a lead.

  WORST-OF-N. `sourceBestLinearWeightsFromLD` reported 8 sems by taking the worst
      of 40 coordinates against a one-coordinate error bar. Declaring
      `selected_from=n` applies the sqrt(2 log n) correction.

  UNREAD REGIME. `cumulativeDrift`, `Var_Delta_Mu` and `pgsDriftVarianceFromLoci`
      were each tested against a reading their own docstring disowns. `regime=`
      was always required; it is now also compared against the definition's
      declared regime where one exists.

FALSE NEGATIVES -- a defect missed:

  SELF-TEST. Two "validations" compared a formula against a Python transcription
      of the same formula. Agreement to machine precision across every cell is
      not evidence; it is the same expression evaluated twice. Detected and
      reported as SELF-TEST, which counts as no measurement at all.

  NO POWER. A design whose prediction barely moves cannot reject a wrong
      functional form. This was already detected but reported alongside passes,
      where it reads as one. It is now a distinct failing verdict.

  DEGENERATE ORACLE. If the simulated truth barely moves across the design, the
      oracle is not exercising the definition even if the prediction does.

  GENERATIVE SELF-TEST -- detected by declaration, not by arithmetic. The
      machine-precision check above catches a formula compared against a
      transcription of itself. It does NOT catch the subtler case where the
      SIMULATION was generated from the definition's own parameters:
      `expectedSquaredEffect = h2/M` was "validated" by drawing effects with
      variance `h2/M` and measuring their mean square, which tests the random
      number generator. Agreement there is guaranteed by construction and the
      residual is pure sampling noise, so it passes every numerical gate.
      `oracle_independent=False` must be declared for such a design, and the
      verdict is GENERATIVE SELF-TEST. The design rule this encodes: the oracle
      must not be built from the quantity under test.

  ASSUMED SEM SHAPE. `spikeAndSlabVariance` reported 10.6 sems at 2.4 percent
      because the error bar on a variance used `sqrt(2/M)`, which is the normal
      formula, against a mixture with a rare heavy component. The sem model is
      as much an assumption as the point estimate.

# ORACLE IDENTITIES -- designs in which the definition IS its own oracle's
# estimator.  A PROPERTY OF THE DESIGN, NOT OF THE DEFINITION.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The SELF-TEST gate below catches a formula that agrees with its oracle to
# machine precision. It does not catch this family: the estimator can reach the
# same expression by a slightly different numerical route, so the harness sees a
# few parts in 10^3 of scatter and banks a MATCH.
#
# THE ALGEBRA. `driftVariance(p0, fst) = p0(1-p0) fst`, whose `fst` is the
# per-branch Wright F. If the battery obtains F from the SAMPLE, as
# `Var(p)/(p0(1-p0))`, then the body is `Var(p)` -- what the oracle computes --
# using no Wright-Fisher property beyond the martingale, and no competitor could
# have been rejected. If the battery obtains F from the MODEL PARAMETERS, as
# `1-(1-1/(2Ne))^t`, agreement is the Wright-Fisher variance recursion and is a
# real prediction that can fail.
#
# THE CORRECTION THIS ENCODES. An earlier version keyed on the definition NAME
# and refused every MATCH for the three below. That was wrong in the expensive
# direction: `battery_bulk21` fed the sample's own F and its MATCHes are vacuous,
# but `battery_bulk41` group B feeds the model's F, MEASURES the Hudson and Nei
# readings on the same replicates as competitors, and FALSIFIES both (Nei by 157
# sems and 47% low, Hudson by 7.8 sems) while the body matches under one sem.
# Same definition, same oracle, opposite verdicts -- so vacuity cannot be a
# property of the definition, and a name-keyed gate would have discarded a real
# measurement.
#
# Hence `argument_source`: "model" -> a real prediction, "sample" -> VACUOUS, and
# silence -> LEAD, never a MATCH. Undeclared is unanswered, not innocent.
#
# TO ADD AN ENTRY you must be able to write the reduction AND name the argument
# whose source decides it. "It looks circular" is not enough.
