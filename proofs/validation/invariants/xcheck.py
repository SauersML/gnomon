"""Cross-check the vacuity verdict against the mutation gate.

=== THE DISTINCTION THIS FILE EXISTS TO PRESERVE ===

    vacuity.py asks:        can the TRUE body violate its bound?
    the mutation gate asks: can the check reject a WRONG body?

THESE ARE NOT THE SAME QUESTION, and on 2026-08-02 both the author of this file
and the agent reviewing it treated them as one.  The wrong inference is
seductive and reads as obvious: "a definition whose range check cannot fail
should be exactly one whose mutants all survive".  It is false.

A check that ACCEPTS THE TRUE BODY and REJECTS MUTATED ONES IS A WORKING CHECK
-- that is what discrimination means.  "The true body cannot violate its own
bound" is what you expect of a CORRECT DEFINITION, not evidence that the check
is empty.  A check is vacuous only if it accepts EVERY body, and only the
mutation gate measures that.

The cost of the conflation, measured: it produced a headline claiming ten AUC
definitions were counted as coverage while unable to fail.  Running this
cross-check refuted it 11 times out of 13 -- those definitions reject mutants
freely.  The genuinely vacuous set was TWO, confirmed by two independent
methods instead of asserted by one.  A stronger claim about a smaller set.

    LIVE + mutants caught          -> both instruments agree the check works
    INTRINSIC + no mutant caught   -> genuinely vacuous, and now double-sourced
    INTRINSIC + mutants caught     -> the check discriminates anyway; the
                                      vacuity verdict says nothing about
                                      coverage, which is the whole lesson above

=== WHY THE UNSCORABLE GUARD IS NOT OPTIONAL ===

The first version of this script printed `agree=71, disagree=41` HAVING
COMPILED NOT ONE MUTANT: it passed an empty namespace to `compile_mutant` (so
every mutant raised), and iterated `mutants()` as if it yielded bare bodies
when it yields (tag, body) pairs.  Every mutant silently failed, `caught`
stayed 0 everywhere, and "0 caught" was then scored as agreement with "cannot
fail".  All 71 agreements were the tautology 0 == 0.

That was the tenth instrument in one day to return a credible number while
measuring nothing.  So a row with zero compiled mutants is UNSCORABLE here,
never scored, and `--selftest` DEMONSTRATES the refusal firing rather than
asserting it -- a guard nobody has watched fire is a guard nobody should trust.

Run:  python xcheck.py            cross-check against results_vacuity.json
      python xcheck.py --selftest exercise the refusal path, exit nonzero on
                                  failure
