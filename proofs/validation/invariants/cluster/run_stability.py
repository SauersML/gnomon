"""CLUSTER JOB 1 (PRIORITY) -- seed-stability sweep of every simulation spec.

WHY THIS RUNS FIRST.  This tier's point-set seed was `hash(name) % 10000`, and
Python salts string hashing per process, so its verdicts were not reproducible
between runs.  Every external verdict it has issued is therefore of unknown
reproducibility.  Fixing the seed does not fix that -- it makes the answer
stable, not correct.  Only running each spec against several INDEPENDENT
point-sets and withdrawing any that flips converts a stable number into a real
one.

A local eight-seed sweep found 2 of 20 specs agreeing on only 4/8 and 5/8 while
being reported as agreeing.  This job re-establishes that on the cluster, at
higher replication, after the fix.

INVOCATION
    module load python3/3.10.9_anaconda2023.03_libmamba
    cd <repo>/proofs/validation/invariants
    python3 cluster/run_stability.py --seeds 8 > cluster/out_stability.txt 2>&1

EXPECTED RUNTIME: a few minutes.  Pure numpy, single process, no threads
beyond numpy's own.  Memory stays under a few hundred MB: the largest array is
one simulated haplotype pool (1.5e6 int8).

WHAT TO SEND BACK: `cluster/out_stability.txt` and
`results_simulation_stability.json`.

READS   sim_engines.py, check_simulation.py, defs.json
WRITES  results_simulation_stability.json (and stdout)
        Does NOT overwrite results_simulation.json.
