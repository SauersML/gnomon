"""Check the genotype sign bias against its closed form.

SCOPE, AND A RETRACTION

An earlier version of this script measured the variance ratio of a sliding-window
design against a disjoint one, to test a predicted coupling inflation
2 b^2 / (1 - b^2). That prediction has been retracted upstream: the argument behind
it used a theta = 1/2 weight where the level-one computation needs another, and at
the correct weights the first-order cross term exposes E[x^4], which the hub channel
already exposes. The term is hub-redundant rather than a separate channel, so there
is no separate inflation to measure and that arm of the script has been removed.

Do not resurrect it from git history without checking whether a replacement mechanism
has been supplied. As of this writing none has.

WHAT REMAINS, AND WHY IT IS WORTH RUNNING

The sign bias itself is untouched by the retraction. It is a property of the genotype
law, and Calibrator.EpistaticChaos.hweSignBias_eq proves

    b = E[x |x|] = (1 - 2q)^2    for q <= 1/2,

where x is the standardized genotype. This script draws Hardy-Weinberg genotypes,
standardizes them, and checks the measured b against that closed form across an
allele-frequency sweep. It tests the corpus's arithmetic against sampled data, which
is the one thing here a simulation can still falsify.

CONTROLS PINNED BY THEORY, NOT BY SIMULATION

  1. MAF 0.5 forces b = 0, because the standardized coordinate is symmetric there
     (Calibrator.EpistaticChaos.standardizedGenotype_symmetric_iff) and b vanishes
     exactly on symmetric laws. A nonzero reading there is a harness fault.
  2. The exact three-point law's b is computed from the probabilities directly, with
     no sampling, and must equal (1 - 2q)^2 to machine precision. If that fails, the
     closed form or the standardization is wrong rather than the sampler.
  3. E[x] = 0 and E[x^2] = 1 are checked on the same samples. Both are proved
     (standardizedGenotype_expectation_zero, standardizedGenotype_second_moment_one),
     so they separate "the sampler is wrong" from "the sign bias is wrong".
