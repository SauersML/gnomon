"""Code validation for the proof corpus: the source-text half.

Every guard in this file reads the LEAN SOURCE TEXT.  `Check.lean`, beside it, is
the elaborated-environment half.  The two are different instruments and neither
subsumes the other:

  * this half sees comments, docstrings, `variable` lines, status markers, the
    shape of what a person actually typed, and files that do not compile.  It
    needs no build, so it runs in seconds and it runs on a broken tree;
  * `Check.lean` sees the premises Lean actually inserted, a definition that
    unfolds to something other than its written form, a proof term's real head
    symbol, whether a type is inhabited, and the transitive axiom closure --
    none of which exists in the source text at all.

Run everything:

    python3 proofs/validation/code/check.py

Run one guard:

    python3 proofs/validation/code/check.py --only laundering
    python3 proofs/validation/code/check.py --only laundering --strict
    python3 proofs/validation/code/check.py --list

Exit is nonzero if any guard that ran fails.  Guard-specific flags go after the
guard name; `--only laundering --json out.json` reaches the laundering guard.

THE GUARDS, and what each one catches:

  style           corpus style policy: license header, module docstring,
                  import placement, line length, snake_case theorem names,
                  `↦` over `=>`, and documentation that narrates development
                  history rather than mathematics.
  identifications structural guards over the corpus: admissions (`sorry` is
                  reported, `admit` is forbidden), convention drift, equilibria
                  with no dynamic, duplicate bodies, and the budget ratchets.
  duplication     the same mathematics written twice: two theorems stating one
                  proposition under two names, one proof script serving two
                  different statements, and verbatim repeated blocks of source.
                  It complements the duplicate-BODY screen in `identifications`,
                  which sees `def` bodies and nothing else.
  mathlib         a corpus declaration whose name Mathlib already uses, which
                  means the corpus re-proved something upstream.  Name-based,
                  so it is a lower bound: a duplicate under a different name is
                  invisible to it.  It FAILS rather than passes when Mathlib's
                  source is absent, because it cannot look.
  laundering      a valid proof of a weaker, conditional, vacuous or circular
                  statement advertised under the intended theorem's name.
  regimes         external theorem packaging in production structures: a
                  scientific conclusion accepted from a caller and re-exported
                  by field projection.
  closure         a Calibrator module outside the root import closure, which
                  `lake build Calibrator` cannot validate and so cannot fail on.
  wiring          an upstream-arc module with no biological dependent: a result
                  adjacent to the corpus rather than wired into it.
  conventions     a quantity used under an unstated or contradictory convention,
                  and a numeric constant that has drifted from the value a source
                  paper gives.  Checked against `validation/conventions.json`,
                  which is the corpus's convention ledger; a definition whose name
                  carries a ledgered quantity and whose entry is missing FAILS, and
                  so does a ledger entry whose declaration no longer exists.
  field-proofs    theorems whose ENTIRE proof is a structure-field projection,
                  measured on origin/main rather than the worktree.  DIAGNOSTIC,
                  not a gate: it has known false positives and never fails the
                  run.  It is excluded from the default set because it shells
                  out to git and reads a remote ref.

WHY ONE FILE.  These seven were seven scripts in three directories, and the cost
was not tidiness.  Three of them independently re-derived "which files are the
corpus" and the three answers disagreed; one walked `proofs/Calibrator/` and
could not see `proofs/Calibrator.lean`, the corpus root, which is a SIBLING of
that directory rather than a child.  Two definitions were deleted as unreferenced
on the strength of that blind spot.  There is now exactly one `REPO`, one
`PROOFS`, and one place to look.

A `sorry` IS PREFERRED TO EVERY PATTERN THESE GUARDS DETECT.  A `sorry` is an
honest, machine-visible, kernel-tracked hole that `Check.lean` reports as
`sorryAx`.  A laundered theorem is an invisible hole that every automated report
calls green.  When the intended statement is not proved, state the intended
statement and admit it; do not restate a provable shadow of it.

# ======================================================================================
# GUARD: identifications -- structural guards over the corpus
#
# Was `proofs/validation/code/check.py`.  Its full header, which carries the
# reasoning behind every budget and the record of two wrong deletions, is
# reproduced immediately below.
# ======================================================================================

#
# Guards, in order of what they catch:
#
# 1. Admissions. Every `sorry` is reported with its owning declaration. A visible
#    admission is incomplete mathematics, but it is preferable to a weakened
#    statement, a laundered premise, or a hidden axiom. `admit` remains forbidden
#    so the corpus has one explicit spelling for unresolved proof obligations.
#
#    The rule is: `sorry` is FREE TO WRITE and BUYS NOTHING. Free to write,
#    because a guard that fails the build on an admission while passing a
#    weakened statement has made honesty the most expensive option on the board
#    and will get what it pays for; `AxiomScan.admissible` records the same
#    decision at the kernel. Buys nothing, because guards 3m, 3n and 3p ignore
#    admitted declarations when deciding what has been established or inhabited.
#    Without that second half, `def witness : Bundle := sorry` would discharge
#    three screens at once by writing down the very assumption they look for.
#
# 2. Convention drift. Every numeric literal 2 or 4 used as a multiplier inside
#    a definition is a restatement of a ploidy or coalescent-scaling convention.
#    The count is pinned; adding new inline restatements without relating them
#    to `ploidy` in Conventions.lean fails, so the number can only go down.
#
# 3. Equilibria with no dynamic. A definition named for a rest point or a limit
#    must be derived as the fixed point of a process defined in the same file,
#    not stipulated as a closed form that no theorem can contradict.
#
# 4. Duplicate bodies across files. Two definitions in different modules whose
#    bodies are alpha-equivalent are one quantity written twice; unless one calls
#    the other or a theorem equates them, fixing one leaves the other wrong.
#
# DO NOT ADD A GUARD THAT DELETES DEFINITIONS BY REFERENCE COUNT. It was tried,
#    twice, and both times it removed correct work. Two failure modes, both proved
#    on 2026-02:
#
#    (a) WRONG ROOT. A scan walking `proofs/Calibrator/` cannot see
#        `proofs/Calibrator.lean`, the corpus root, which is a SIBLING of that
#        directory rather than a child. `decaySlope` was deleted as having "no use
#        anywhere"; its only consumer was a theorem in the root. `LDDecayMechanism`
#        was then deleted for having "lost its only consumer" -- the second
#        deletion inheriting the first's blind spot. The file list built below
#        includes `Calibrator.lean` explicitly for exactly this reason; do not
#        "simplify" it into a single recursive glob.
#
#    (b) UNREFERENCED BY DESIGN, which no reference count can detect.
#        `targetCorrectionCurvature` and `targetCorrectionOptimum` are applied by
#        nothing, AND THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE FOR: `sharedCorrectionConsensus` and
#        `sharedCorrectionSpread` take `curvature` and `optimum` as arbitrary
#        `ι → ℝ`, and these two say which functions the section is about. Their
#        section docstring claims the curvature weight is "forced rather than
#        stipulated" -- without them it is a free parameter, the spread law holds
#        for any weights whatsoever, and that sentence is false. A definition that
#        names which functions a section is ABOUT is unreferenced by design, so
#        every one of that category is a false positive waiting to be deleted.
#
#    Neither deletion broke the build, and that is the part to internalise. In (a)
#    Lean auto-binds an undefined bare name as an implicit variable, so the
#    consuming theorem kept elaborating as a claim about nothing. In (b) the
#    arguments were already abstract, so removing the definitions that gave them
#    meaning changed no type. ABSENCE OF A BUILD FAILURE IS NOT EVIDENCE THAT A
#    DELETION WAS SAFE. Before removing anything as unused, grep the FULL `proofs/`
#    tree -- root module and validation Python included -- and grep the PROSE, not
#    just the identifier: in both cases a docstring within a few lines of the
#    deletion site named the consumer outright.
#
# 5. Regimes baked into bodies. A definition whose value depends on an assumption
#    about the data-generating process -- closed population, no mutation, infinite
#    sites -- must name that assumption, because a formula carries no record of
#    the regime it was derived in and a use site cannot discharge what it cannot
#    see.
#
# 6. Validation inherited from a sibling identity. Over-determination detects
#    divergence between formulas and is provably blind to a premise they share, so
#    a VALIDATED tag must cite a measurement against an observable, never another
#    definition. Guards 6 and 7 exist because one wrong number was certified five
#    times, each time by a cross-check that could not have failed.
#
# 7. Validation with no power. A validation is evidence in proportion to the range
#    its prediction spanned; a design on which the prediction is constant cannot
#    reject a wrong functional form, however small the residual.
#
# 8. Laundered assumptions. An unproved proposition can be made to look proved
#    without a `sorry` and without an axiom: name it as a theorem, pass it as an
#    ordinary argument, bundle it into a setup structure, project that structure's
#    fields into local instances so they bind silently, and give the wrapper an
#    unconditional-sounding name. `#print axioms` stays clean through all five
#    moves, because an assumption discharged by the caller is invisible to a scan
#    that reads only the proof term. Four screens ask instead whether anything can
#    ever satisfy the hypothesis: a proposition never concluded (3m), a bundle
#    never inhabited (3n), a supplied field installed as an instance (3o), and a
#    result whose name hides what it rests on (3p). Each count is pinned at what
#    was measured and ratchets down, so the corpus cannot acquire new ones.
#
#    Prefer `sorry`. An admission is a debt this corpus can enumerate; a laundered
#    premise is a debt it cannot, and guard 1 exists to keep the first cheap.
#
# 9. Trust-boundary syntax. Production proof modules may not declare custom
#    axioms, use native/compiler-backed decision procedures, introduce unsafe
#    declarations, or install custom syntax/elaborators.  These checks cover
#    explicit source constructs; the environment-level axiom scan remains
#    responsible for dependencies hidden behind imports or generated terms.
#
# Guards 5-7 are the subject of `Calibrator.DriftRegime`, which proves that 6 and 7
# are impossibilities rather than oversights.

# Was `os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..", "proofs")` when this guard

# THE RECORD THE ZEROING WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE DESTROYED.

# Seven of the budgets above were not always 0. They were pinned at a MEASURED
# count and ratcheted downwards, and the guard's own header still describes that
# discipline: each count "pinned at what was measured", so "the corpus cannot
# acquire new ones". Those numbers were the measurement. Setting them all to 0
# in a single edit enforces the right standard and destroys the record at the
# same time, and without the record nobody can read a later run: 7 unwitnessed
# bundles is excellent progress from 38 and a bad regression from 0, and the
# number alone does not say which.
#
# So the standard is 0 and the history is kept here. Each entry is the last value
# the budget carried before the zeroing, and the commit that set it.
#
# Two of the seven have since been genuinely cleared to 0 -- LAUNDERED_PROP from
# 16, UNCONDITIONAL_NAME from 35. That is only visible because the old numbers

    #     A screen that invents its own findings is worse than a screen that
    #     misses some: the inventions cost a reader the time to refute them and
    #     teach everyone to discount the real ones. Marking those four with an
    #     Empirical status would have recorded a claim about linkage
    #     disequilibrium that none of them makes.
    #
    #     Dropping `re.I` alone is NOT the fix, and measuring said so. Bare
    #     `ld[A-Z_]` still matches every `threshold` followed by a capital --
    #     `thresholdQalyLoss`, `thresholdBandRate`, nine of them -- because
    #     "threshold" ends in the letters l, d. And it misses the eleven names

# GUARD: laundering -- proof of a weaker statement under the right name
#
# Was `proofs/validation/code/check.py`.  Its full header, which defines the standard
# and enumerates every family this guard detects, is reproduced immediately below.
# ======================================================================================

# Ban proof laundering: a valid Lean proof of a weaker, conditional, vacuous, or
# circular statement presented as the intended theorem.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT.  It is not a kernel check.  The kernel is not being fooled in any
# of the patterns below; every one of them typechecks.  `proofs/validation/code/check.py`
# guards the source text and `proofs/validation/code/Check.lean` guards the
# transitive axiom closure, and NEITHER CAN SEE ANY OF THIS, because a laundered proof
# has no `sorry`, no custom axiom, and a clean `#print axioms` report.  The defect is
# that the declaration's TYPE is not the advertised mathematics.
#
# THE STANDARD, which is the only one that matters and which no tool applies for you:
#
#     A development has closed a theorem only when the final declaration states exactly
#     the intended mathematics, has no unresolved substantive premise (explicit, implicit,
#     or instance), constructs every certificate it consumes, instantiates every abstract
#     parameter with a concrete object proved to satisfy it, quantifies over a domain
#     proved nonempty, and has a clean transitive axiom report.
#
#     Anything less may be a useful conditional library.  It is not the advertised proof.
#
# A `sorry` IS PREFERRED TO EVERY PATTERN BELOW.  A `sorry` is an honest, machine-visible,
# kernel-tracked hole that the AXIOMS scan in Check.lean reports as `sorryAx`.  A laundered theorem is
# an invisible hole that every automated report calls green.  When the intended statement
# is not proved, state the intended statement and admit it; do not restate a provable
# shadow of it.  This inverts the usual repository rule -- see the LEDGER section in
# `proofs/validation/code/check.py` -- and it is deliberate.
#
# FAMILIES DETECTED.  Numbering follows the audit taxonomy; `severity` decides exit code.
#
#   FATAL -- the declaration does not prove what its name says.
#     F1   hypothesis laundering: the conclusion is one of the hypotheses, verbatim.
#     F1b  proof is a bare application of a hypothesis binder (`h`, `h x`, `hDeep prem`).
#     F4   certificate laundering: a parameter is a structure carrying the conclusion
#          (or any Prop) in a field; the theorem consumes a certificate it never builds.
#          Also reported when the whole proof is `h.field` or `h.field h'` -- the field
#          handed straight back.  NOT reported when an argument to the field is itself a
#          proved step (`B.fails (S.collapses B ▸ B.holds)`): that is modus ponens on a
#          corpus theorem, the same case the `h s` rule below already exempts, and the
#          2026-08 audit of `ProbeSeparation.no_blindness` found it to be a false positive
#          -- both structures there are constructed in-corpus and the content is in
#          `witness_collapses`.
#     F7   conclusion-by-definition: a predicate one of whose conjuncts IS the conclusion.
#     F8   definitional weakening: a target property defined as `True` or trivially.
#     F9   premise strengthening: premise and conclusion are the same existential.
#     F11  inconsistent instance context: a class with a `False` field, or premises
#          asserting both `Nontrivial` and `Subsingleton` of one type.
#     F24  trust bypass: custom `axiom`, `native_decide`, `unsafe`, custom elaborators.
#
#   CONDITIONAL -- valid implication, but the antecedent is unproved in this corpus.
#     F2   Prop alias with a theorem-like name and no inhabitant anywhere.
#     F3   typeclass laundering: a nonstandard class, `Fact`, `Nonempty`, `Inhabited`, or
#          a local instance obtained from a caller-supplied field. A local instance proved
#          in the tactic block is ordinary proof plumbing, not an assumption.
#     F16  wrapper chain: every Prop-valued binder in a theorem's signature.
#     F19  hidden assumptions: Prop-valued *implicit* and *instance* binders, plus
#          section `variable`s inherited silently.
#     F23  conditional bootstrapping: `Nonempty`/`Exists` conclusion whose witness came
#          in as an argument.
#
#   FIDELITY -- statement may be right, but nothing ties it to the intended object.
#     F5   existential repackaging.
#     F6   `Classical.choice`/`choose` applied to an assumed existence premise.
#     F10  vacuity: quantification over a domain with no inhabitant proved in-corpus.
#     F12  subtype laundering: domain is `{x // DesiredProperty x}`.
#     F13  a `.range`/image construction named as if it were the canonical object.
#     F15  prose claims one definition induces another and no theorem states the bridge.
#     F17  name inflation: `_complete`, `_proved`, `_exists`, `explicit_` on a
#          declaration that still carries premises.
#     F18  `#print axioms` aimed at a Prop DEFINITION rather than at a proof of it.
#     F20  semantic shadowing: a corpus predicate reusing a standard name.
#     F21  degenerate normalization: a THEOREM whose conclusion divides by a quantity
#          no premise shows is nonzero. Not definitions -- they have nothing to guard.
#     F22  the noun does the work: a parameter structure whose field IS the conclusion.
#
#   NOT DETECTED, deliberately -- listed so a clean report is not read as covering it:
#     F14  concrete-looking dead end. Every mechanical proxy is a reference count, and
#          a reference count cannot distinguish a dead end from a definition that is
#          unreferenced BY DESIGN (`X.witness`, `targetCorrectionCurvature`). Reference
#          counting has twice deleted correct work in this repository. See the comment
#          at the F14 site in `check_files`.

# Exit status is 1 if any FATAL or CONDITIONAL finding survives.  There is deliberately

#
# LIMITS, stated so a clean report is not over-read.  This is a source-text analysis: it
# sees what was typed, not what the elaborator produced.  It cannot see premises
# introduced by `export`ed instances from an import, a `Fact` synthesised at elaboration
# time, or a definition unfolded to something other than its written form.  The
# environment-level companion, `proofs/validation/code/Check.lean`, walks
# the fully elaborated telescope of every `Calibrator` declaration and is authoritative
# where the two disagree.  Run both.

# WHAT GATES, AND WHY IT IS NOT EVERYTHING.
#
# FATAL gates.  Those families are laundering proper: the declaration does not prove
# what its name says, and no amount of context makes that acceptable.
#
# CONDITIONAL does not gate by default, and this is a deliberate line rather than a
# concession.  A theorem of the form `(hx : 0 < x) : f x < f (x + 1)` has a Prop-valued
# premise and is ordinary mathematics; so does every theorem quantified over a model
# class that the corpus proves nonempty.  Gating on those would make the guard
# permanently red, and a permanently red guard is read as broken and then ignored --
# which is how the patterns it exists to catch get in.  The CONDITIONAL count is
# printed as a LEDGER on every run: it is the honest size of what this corpus assumes,
# it is meant to be read, and it is meant to go down.
#
# `--strict` gates on CONDITIONAL as well.  That is the standard the corpus is aiming
# at, and the flag exists so the aim is checkable rather than aspirational.

#
# Every name here was a structure whose Prop-valued fields CONTAINED THE DESIRED
# CONCLUSION, paired with a theorem that reached that conclusion by `rw` or `exact` on one
# of those fields. `kernelTrivial_of_no_section` applied `D.dichotomy`;
# `assumedCeiling_collapses_to_support_wall` rewrote with `C.characterization`. The
# statement's content was the assumption, so it was not a theorem of this corpus.
#
# Naming such a structure `Assumed...` does not repair it. That is why
# `AssumedDeploymentCeiling` and `AssumedMembraneThreshold` are on this list despite having
# been honestly named: an honest name on a restatement still yields a restatement.
#
# THE ENTRIES ARE NOT STALE CRUFT. A name here means the structure was deleted deliberately
# and must not return. If the `regimes` guard fails on one of these, something reintroduced it,
# and the repair is to remove the reintroduction — NOT to prune the list. Pruning restores
# the blindness rather than fixing the break, which is the failure mode every guard in this
# corpus has eventually suffered.
#
# The honest alternative, when the underlying input is real, is the one used in
# `Calibrator.BundleRigidity.DeploymentCeiling`: state the input as a TYPED HYPOTHESIS of
# the theorem that needs it, so it appears in the signature and cannot be forgotten, and
# leave the unproved direction as a named gap with no theorem attached. A used hypothesis
# is an argument of the theorem that needs it; an unused one in a record is decoration.

# GUARD: wiring -- is a result wired into the biology, or only adjacent to it
#
# Was `proofs/validation/code/check.py`.  Its full header is reproduced
# immediately below.
# ======================================================================================

#
# The condition this enforces is the team lead's, and it is deliberately not a
# style rule:
#
#     A result is wired in when removing it breaks something biological.
#
# That is testable. For a Lean corpus it means: some module outside the upstream
# arc must *reference a declaration* of the arc module. Import edges alone do not
# count -- a module can import another and use nothing from it, and the import
# graph then records an intention rather than a dependency. Conversely a shared
# vocabulary does not count either: two modules can both talk about allele
# frequencies while neither depends on the other, which is the "two corpora that
# agree" failure this script exists to detect.
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES
#
# For every module in ARC, collect its declared names, then count references to
# those names from modules outside ARC, with docstrings and comments stripped so
# that a mention in prose is not scored as a dependency. A module with zero
# genuine cross-boundary references is UNWIRED however many files import it.
#
# WHY THE COMMENT-STRIPPING MATTERS
#
# The corpus's house style cites sibling theorems in docstrings extensively. Those
# citations are how a reader navigates, and they are exactly what makes an
# unwired module look wired. Stripping them is the whole point of the measurement.
#
# KNOWN PARSE HAZARD, HANDLED
#
# Lean keywords can follow a `def`-like token in constructs this regex does not
# model, which yields phantom declarations named `in`, `at`, `with`. Those match
# everywhere and manufacture false dependencies. Short and reserved names are
# therefore dropped; an earlier version of this script reported six spurious
# dependents of HiddenConeAmbiguity, all of them the keyword `in`.

# Find theorems whose ENTIRE proof is a structure-field projection, on origin/main.
#
# This is the review's defect in its mechanically checkable form, and the standard is
# the coordinator's: if replacing the proof body with the field yields the same theorem,
# there is no theorem. Such a proof states nothing -- the conclusion IS the hypothesis.
#
# Precise by construction: no prose parsing, no backtick guessing. A theorem qualifies
# only if its proof body reduces to `X.f` / `exact X.f` / `X.f args` where `f` is a
# declared field of a structure in this corpus.
#
# Runs against origin/main, never the worktree. THIS IS NOT A STYLE POINT. On 2026-08-03
# three agents in one day reported a structure "removed from the corpus" after grepping a
# worktree that carried another agent's UNCOMMITTED deletions. A worktree grep and an origin
# grep answer different questions, and only the second answers "is this in the corpus".
#
# CALIBRATION AND KNOWN LIMITS -- read before quoting a number.
#
#   Calibrated against ground truth: it independently finds the `GenotypeChaosLimits`
#   consumers in EpistaticChaos that an external review named, which is the evidence that
#   it detects the real thing.
#
#   It also found sites the review did not name. Two verified by hand:
#     * PortabilityBounds.FittedSelectionLaw.magnitude_pinned -- the purest instance in the
#       corpus. The field `fits` IS the theorem's statement; the proof is `F.fits fst hlo hhi`.
#     * EpistaticChaos.no_moment_matching_calibration_off_temperedness := CD.divergence_phase.
#
#   FALSE POSITIVES REMAIN and the raw count is NOT a measurement. Two modes, one fixed and
#   one open:
#     FIXED  -- taking the first `:=` in the declaration text picked up field names out of
#               HYPOTHESIS binders (`(h : (let mu := dgp.jointMeasure) = ...)`), reporting a
#               hypothesis as a proof. Now takes the last `:=`.
#     OPEN   -- line-joining can absorb a following tactic or the next declaration, so
#               entries whose printed proof ends in `linarith`, `simpa using h`,
#               `positivity`, or `open ... in` have MORE proof than the projection and are
#               probably not this defect. Inspect every hit before acting on it.
#
#   NOT EVERY HIT IS A DEFECT. An accessor forwarding a genuine model invariant can be
#   plumbing. The retired `Identification.formula_eq_observable := i.derivation` pattern,
#   however, is now forbidden: it accepted the desired scientific conclusion from a caller.
#   The defect is a theorem whose name and statement claim a result that a field already
#   asserts.
#
#   The standard to apply, which no tool can apply for you: if replacing the proof body with
#   the field yields the same theorem, there is no theorem.

#                names.  This is the definition case's exact analogue and it is
#                worse, because a theorem's content is entirely its statement:
#                the second name adds no mathematics, it adds a second thing that
#                must be kept in step by hand, and a reader who finds one has no
#                way to know the other exists.
#   proofs       two theorems with DIFFERENT statements and a character-identical
#                proof script.  A repeated script is a lemma that has not been

#
# WHAT IS NOT REPORTED, and why.  A tie is credit here exactly as it is in the

# ======================================================================================
# MATHLIB: A CORPUS DECLARATION THAT ALREADY EXISTS UPSTREAM
# ======================================================================================
#
# The corpus must never write something Mathlib already has.  Re-proving an
# upstream lemma is not merely redundant: the local copy is the one that goes
# stale, it is stated under whatever hypotheses the local proof happened to
# need rather than the general ones, and every later reader has to establish
# for themselves that the two agree.  Four cases were found and removed by
# hand -- `one_sub_lt_exp_neg` (weaker than `Real.one_sub_lt_exp_neg`, which
# needs only `x != 0`), `constant_div_natSucc_tendsto_zero`
# (`tendsto_const_div_atTop_nhds_zero_nat`), `dotProduct_comm`, and the whole
# `sigmoid` block (`Real.sigmoid`) -- and this guard exists so the fifth is
# found by a machine.
#
# WHAT IT MEASURES.  A corpus declaration whose own name is, verbatim, the name
# of a Mathlib declaration.  Name equality is the signal because Mathlib's
# naming convention is generated from the statement: two declarations that
# Mathlib would name identically state the same fact about the same operators
# in the same order.  It is a lower bound, not a survey -- a duplicate written
# under a different name is invisible here, and that is the honest limit of a
# name-based screen.  It is stated so no reader mistakes a clean report for
# "the corpus duplicates nothing".
#
# WHY NOT SUFFIX MATCHING.  Comparing bare final components (`Foo.mono` against
# `Mathlib`'s `Bar.mono`) produces almost nothing but noise: structure
# projections, `ext`, `mono`, `nonempty` and `symm` collide across every
# namespace in both libraries and mean nothing.  Only dotless corpus names are
# considered, which is exactly the set that lands in the `Calibrator` root.
#
# WHICH MATHLIB NAMES COUNT.  Mathlib's FULL name, namespace included, because
# `CategoryTheory.core`, `SimpleGraph.Walk.transfer` and `Ordinal.gamma` are
# not in scope for this corpus and a bare-name comparison reported all three.
# A Mathlib declaration collides only if its full name is the corpus name
# itself, or is that name inside a namespace THIS CORPUS OPENS -- which is read
# off the corpus's own `open` lines rather than hardcoded, so it tracks the
# corpus instead of drifting from it.  That is what keeps `Real.sigmoid` and
# `Matrix.dotProduct_comm` findings while dropping the category theory.
#
# WHY IT CANNOT SILENTLY PASS.  The guard needs Mathlib's SOURCE, which lives
# in `.lake/packages/mathlib` and is absent on a tree that has never been
# built.  A guard that quietly reports zero findings when it could not look is
# the failure mode this whole directory exists to prevent, so a missing Mathlib
# is a FAILURE with the path it looked for, not a pass.  Point it elsewhere
# with GNOMON_MATHLIB.

# Every budget here is 0, like every other budget in this file.  Nothing is
# grandfathered: the four known collisions were removed before the guard
# landed, not pinned.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE SECOND SCREEN: WHAT THE THEOREM SAYS, NOT WHAT IT IS CALLED
#
# Name equality is a lower bound and a narrow one.  A duplicate written under a
# different name -- which is the common case, because a corpus author who knew
# the Mathlib name would have used the Mathlib lemma -- is invisible to it.
# `constant_div_natSucc_tendsto_zero` and `tendsto_const_div_atTop_nhds_zero_nat`
# share no token at all, and were the same theorem.
#
# So the statement itself is normalised and compared.  The normal form is the
# CONCLUSION with every bound variable replaced by `_` and every namespace
# prefix dropped, so `Real.exp (-x)` and `exp (-h)` become the same text.  What
# survives is the operator skeleton and the global constants, which is what
# "the same theorem" means when the two libraries name their variables
# differently and sit in different namespaces.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO.  It does not look at hypotheses.  A corpus
# lemma whose conclusion matches a Mathlib lemma but which assumes more is
# exactly the case worth reporting -- that is `one_sub_lt_exp_neg` requiring
# `0 < h` where Mathlib requires `x != 0` -- and hiding it behind a hypothesis
# comparison would have suppressed the first finding this guard was written
# for.  Nor does it elaborate: it is source text, so `2⁻¹` and `1 / 2` are
# different, and a statement phrased through a corpus abbreviation does not
# match the unfolded Mathlib one.  Both limits cut the same way, toward missing
# duplicates rather than inventing them.
#
# SIGNIFICANCE FLOOR.  A normal form has to carry at least
# MATHLIB_SHAPE_MIN_CONSTANTS distinct global constants and
# MATHLIB_SHAPE_MIN_LENGTH characters to be reported.  Without it every
# `_ ≤ _` in the corpus matches a hundred Mathlib lemmas and the screen reports
# noise at a volume that guarantees nobody reads it.
# These three floors are MEASURED, not chosen.  Over the corpus and Mathlib as
# they stand, `constants >= 3` reports nothing AND cannot report the known
# duplicate the screen was written for -- `1 - _ < exp (-_)` names exactly one
# constant -- so the floor that looked safe was the floor that made the screen
# decorative.  At `constants >= 1, length >= 15` the corpus yields exactly one
# match, `target = target`, which is a corpus field name equal to itself and
# says nothing.  Hence the third floor: a normal form must also carry at least
# MATHLIB_SHAPE_MIN_OPERATORS operator occurrences, which `X = X` fails with
# one and `1 - _ < exp (-_)` passes with three.  The self-test below holds all
# three to the known pair.

# ======================================================================================
# CONVENTIONS -- the convention ledger, and the four ways it can be violated
# ======================================================================================
#
# WHAT THIS IS FOR.  A convention is invisible to Lean.  Nei's `G_ST`, Hudson's
# `F_ST` and the per-branch drift `F` are all reals in `[0,1)`, all named `fst`,
# and every one of them type-checks in the others' place.  This corpus has paid
# for that three times: the factor-of-four `F_ST` error, a Nei body carrying the
# name `hudsonFst`, and a within-population heterozygosity loss documented as a
# between-population variance ratio.  Each was caught by a person reading the
# corpus against a paper.  `proofs/validation/conventions.json` is that reading
# written down as DATA; this guard is what makes the data load-bearing.
#
# THE FOUR RULES, all at budget 0:
#
#   UNLEDGERED   a `def` whose name carries a ledgered quantity's word, under a
#                quantity whose scope is `complete`, with no ledger entry.  The
#                ledger is where the convention is stated, so "no entry" and
#                "no stated convention" are the same condition.
#   STALE        a ledger entry naming a declaration the corpus no longer has,
#                or a bridge naming a theorem the corpus no longer has.  A
#                committed snapshot of a moving corpus goes stale by
#                construction; the only safe design is to make staleness LOUD.
#   UNBRIDGED    one module carrying two conventions the ledger declares
#                incompatible, with no chain of existing bridge theorems
#                connecting them.  `Conventions.lean` may hold both `hudsonFst`
#                and `neiGst` precisely because `hudsonFst_eq_of_neiGst` exists.
#   CONSTANT     a ledgered `constants` multiset that the definition's body no
#                longer has.  This is the durable half of a constant audit: a
#                future edit turning a `4` into a `2` fails here instead of
#                waiting for somebody to re-read the source paper.
#
# ANCHORED TO NAMES, NEVER TO OFFSETS.  Every ledger key is
# `<module>::<declaration>`.  A ledger pinned to line numbers fails on edits
# that have nothing to do with it, which is exactly how `extract/test_parser.py`
# came to be red, and a gate that is red for an unrelated reason stops being
# read.
#
# NOT A REFERENCE COUNT.  This guard never counts citations and never requires
# one.  That shape is deliberately absent from this file (family F14): it has
# twice deleted correct work here.  A ledger entry's `source` is free text that
# no rule inspects.

# LEDGER: the simulation-coverage verdict record against the docstrings
# ======================================================================================
#
# WHAT THIS CATCHES, and why it is a guard rather than a habit.
#
# Coverage in this corpus is a DOCSTRING property -- a definition counts as
# measured when its own `Empirical status:` line says so -- while the evidence
# lives in `proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/`, in sixty-odd battery result
# files that nothing read.  Two things follow, and both happened:
#
#   * batteries ran AHEAD of the docstrings.  Definitions carried a real verdict
#     and still read UNTESTED, so the coverage number understated what had been
#     established and nobody could tell which.
#   * docstrings ran AHEAD of the batteries.  Definitions read VALIDATED off a
#     MATCH that no competing formula was ever run against, which is not a
#     validation: an oracle algebraically pinned to the body under test cannot
#     reject anything, so agreement with it is arithmetic.  `driftVariance`,
#     `haplotypeHomozygosity` and `multiTraitEffectiveSampleSize` were each
#     banked that way.
#
# `simcov/ledger.json` is the committed record, emitted by `simcov/ledger.py`
# from the battery results.  THE COMPETITOR GATE IS APPLIED AT EMIT TIME: a
# corpus row that agrees with its oracle while no competing formula was rejected
# on the same cells is recorded as UNINFORMATIVE, not MATCH.  That is why rule 3
# below reads as though it can never fire -- it fires only if someone hand-edits
# the ledger, which is exactly the hole a generated-and-committed file has.
#
# The guard is deterministic, needs no simulator, no numpy and no network, and
# anchors everything on DECLARATION NAMES.  Nothing here pins a line number:
# `empirical/extract/test_parser.py` is a standing demonstration of what happens
# when a check does.
#
# THE RULES, all at budget 0:
#
#   1. A docstring citing a battery FILE the ledger has never seen.  A renamed
#      or deleted battery leaves a citation pointing at nothing, and a citation
#      that cannot be followed is worse than none: it reads as evidence.
#   2. A docstring that cites a battery whose results are STALE -- the battery's
#      source is newer than the results file, so the numbers quoted came from a
#      source that no longer exists.
#   3. A ledger record banking agreement with no competitor rejected.
#   4. A definition whose docstring cites a battery while the ledger holds both
#      an agreeing and a disagreeing verdict for it, with no adjudication.  A
#      definition cannot be both validated and falsified; one of the two designs
#      is wrong and the docstring has to say which.
#
# REPORTED, NOT GATED, and named as outstanding work rather than given a budget:
# definitions whose docstring asserts agreement while every ledger record for
# them disagrees.  These are real findings -- each is either a stale docstring
# or a stale record -- but a verdict is evidence about the FORMULA a battery
# transcribed, and when a body is corrected the old record becomes history.
# Deciding that automatically needs the transcription and the Lean body to be
# comparable, and they are not: `sum beta_i^2` and `∑ i : Fin m, β i ^ 2` are
# the same formula and share no text.  Until each is adjudicated by hand the
# count is printed in full, with names, so it cannot be mistaken for zero.
