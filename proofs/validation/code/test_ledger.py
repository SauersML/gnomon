"""Calibration for the `ledger` guard, in BOTH directions.

    python3 proofs/validation/code/test_ledger.py

A guard with no calibration is a guard nobody can quote. This one is calibrated
the way `test_check.py` calibrates the laundering detector: against planted
inputs whose correct answer is known before the run, and in both directions,
because a detector that never fires and a detector that always fires are equally
useless and look identical from a passing build.

WHAT IS PLANTED, and what each case is for:

  CLEAN. A ledger and a corpus that agree, with every citation resolvable and
  every agreement competed. Must produce zero findings at gating severity. This
  is the direction that usually goes untested, and it is the one that catches a
  guard which has quietly started failing on everything.

  A PLANTED WRONG FORMULA must be reported. A definition whose docstring claims
  VALIDATED while every ledger record for it says FALSIFIED is the drift this
  guard exists for, and it must appear in the reported list.

  A PLANTED IDENTITY must be recorded as UNINFORMATIVE, not as a MATCH. This is
  the single most important case: `driftVariance`, `haplotypeHomozygosity` and
  `multiTraitEffectiveSampleSize` were all banked as validations off an oracle
  algebraically pinned to the body, and the emitter is supposed to make that
  structurally impossible. The test drives `simcov/ledger.py` on a synthetic
  results file carrying a MATCH with no competitor and asserts the emitted
  verdict is UNINFORMATIVE.

  A HAND-EDITED LEDGER must fail. The competitor gate lives in the emitter, so
  the one way to bank an uncompeted agreement is to edit `ledger.json` directly.
  That must be a build failure, or the gate is advisory.

  A DANGLING CITATION must fail, and a STALE citation must fail.
