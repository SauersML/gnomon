# Code validation, elaborated-environment half

Every check in this file reads the ELABORATED ENVIRONMENT: what the kernel
accepted, not what a person typed.  `proofs/validation/code/check.py` is the
source-text half.  The two are not redundant and neither subsumes the other:

  * the text scan names the line a person typed, and can see a comment, a
    docstring, a `variable` line, and a file that does not compile;
  * this scan sees the premises Lean actually inserted, a definition that
    unfolds to something other than its written form, a proof term's real head
    symbol, whether a type is inhabited, and the transitive axiom closure --
    none of which exists in the source text at all.

Run, after a successful build of `Calibrator` and `ValidationShared`:

    lake env lean proofs/validation/code/Check.lean

Exit is nonzero when any FATAL finding survives.  Admissions (`sorryAx`) are
reported and counted but do NOT fail the run; see `Axioms.admissible` for why
closing that exit would select for laundering rather than for proof.

## The four scans, and what each one is for

  AXIOMS      the transitive axiom closure of every declaration.  Fails on a
              custom axiom or a compiler axiom (`native_decide`).  Reports
              `sorryAx` as an admission.
  LAUNDERING  the premises the kernel sees.  Fails when a theorem's name is a
              claim its TYPE does not support.
  INFLATION   theorems whose proof is their own assumed hypothesis, and
              assumption-carrying structures the corpus never constructs.
  RFL         theorems whose proof term is literally `Eq.refl`.

## One shared declaration filter

All four scans ask "did a person write this declaration", and all four now ask
`Shared.userWritten`.  THIS FILE IS WHERE THAT WAS FIXED.  Before the merge the
axiom and laundering scans each carried a private copy of the filter and the
inflation and rfl scans used `Shared`; the copies disagreed, so tools reported
totals over different populations while looking equally authoritative.
`Shared.DeclFilter` carries the row-by-row table of how they differed.

The private copies differed from `Shared` in one respect: neither excluded
`eq_unfold`, Lean's generated unfolding lemma.  Unifying therefore drops a
handful of generated lemmas from the axiom and laundering populations.  That is
a correction in the safe direction -- a generated lemma's axiom closure is
contained in that of the user-authored root it was generated from, so nothing
the scan would otherwise report can be hidden by it -- but it does mean
`AXIOM_SCAN_SCANNED` and `LAUNDER_SCANNED` are not comparable across this
change.  Do not read a drop in those denominators as work disappearing.

/-! ## AXIOMS — the transitive axiom closure

Report the transitive axiom closure of every `Calibrator` declaration, and fail
on anything outside the three foundations Lean's own standard library rests on.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  The source-text half guards `sorry` with a regex over the
source text.  That is a scan of what a person typed, and the question is what
the KERNEL accepted.  The two come apart in the direction that matters:

  * A declaration can depend on `sorryAx` with no `sorry` in its source.  On
    2026-08-03 `proofs/Calibrator/ConditionalGain.lean` reopened the namespace
    `FiniteCoupledPhaseLaw` without re-declaring its `variable {n d : ℕ}`, so
    `toFiberCoupling` mentioned two unbound identifiers.  Lean recovered from
    the elaboration error by inserting synthetic sorries, and reported
    `declaration uses 'sorry'` for two theorems whose source text contains no
    such word.  A text scan cannot see those, and the ledger it checks them
    against would not have been consulted.
  * Conversely the word appears in three docstrings in this corpus that discuss
    the ledger, so the text scan has to special-case its own false positives.

Nothing else in the repository looks at axioms at all: there is no
`#print axioms`, no `collectAxioms`, and no `lean4checker` invocation anywhere
in `proofs/`, `scripts/`, or `.github/workflows/`.  A custom `axiom` declared in
any module, or a `native_decide` anywhere, would be reported by no guard.
-/

namespace Axioms

/-- The axioms a Mathlib development is entitled to.  `propext`, `Classical.choice`
and `Quot.sound` are Lean's foundations, not assumptions this corpus is making.

Deliberately absent, and each one a different failure: `Lean.ofReduceBool` and
`Lean.trustCompiler` (`native_decide`, which moves the compiler into the trusted
base), and every axiom declared in this repository. -/
def allowed : List Name :=
  [``propext, ``Classical.choice, ``Quot.sound]

/-- `sorryAx` is an ADMISSION, not an offence, and this scan reports it without
failing.  That is a deliberate asymmetry, and it is the whole point of the split.

A guard that fails the build on `sorryAx` while also failing it on custom axioms,
`native_decide` and rebound notation has closed every exit at once.  What it has
actually done is make the honest admission the MOST expensive option available:
writing `sorry` breaks CI, whereas weakening the statement until it is provable,
moving the hard half into a hypothesis nobody discharges, or proving the theorem
about a degenerate surrogate all leave a green build.  The guard then selects for
exactly the laundering families the LAUNDERING scan below exists to detect.

So the order of preference this file encodes, worst to best:

  * a custom axiom, a compiler-backed proof, a rebound `+` -- REJECTED, always;
  * a theorem whose statement was quietly weakened to fit the proof available --
    not visible here at all, which is why the LAUNDERING and INFLATION scans
    below and the vacuity and range detectors under `empirical/` exist;
  * an admitted proof obligation, named and counted -- REPORTED, and allowed to
    stay in the corpus for as long as it takes to discharge;
  * a proof.

An admission is a debt with the debtor's name on it.  The closure is transitive,
so every downstream consumer reports it too and the printed list is the blast
radius, not a single line.  That is the property that makes it safe to permit:
nothing that rests on an admission can look finished.

`ADMISSION_SCAN_COUNT` is printed unconditionally, including when it is zero, so
that "no admissions" is a measurement rather than the absence of a line. -/
def admissible : List Name :=
  [``sorryAx]

/-- Classify one declaration's axiom closure.

`none` means clean.  `some (false, bad)` is an ADMISSION: everything outside the
foundations is admissible, i.e. the closure's only extra entry is `sorryAx`.
`some (true, bad)` is an OFFENCE and fails the run.

A declaration that depends on BOTH `sorryAx` and a custom axiom is an offence,
not an admission -- otherwise adding one `sorry` anywhere in a proof would buy
silence for every axiom it also happens to rest on. -/
def classify (allowed admissible : List Name) (ax : Array Name) :
    Option (Bool × Array Name) :=
  let bad := ax.filter fun a ↦ !(allowed.contains a)
  if bad.isEmpty then none
  else some (bad.any fun a ↦ !(admissible.contains a), bad)

/-- The names this scan is responsible for.

Scan every axiom, including unused custom axioms.  For value-bearing
declarations scan user-authored roots: generated declarations cannot introduce
an axiom absent from those roots, and explicit source guards independently
reject custom elaborators and compiler-backed proofs. -/
def roots (env : Environment) : Array Name := Id.run do
  let mut out := #[]
  for (name, ci) in env.constants.toList do
    unless Check.isOurs name do continue
    match ci with
    | .axiomInfo _ => out := out.push name
    | .thmInfo _ | .defnInfo _ | .opaqueInfo _ =>
      if Check.userWritten env name then out := out.push name
    | _ => pure ()
  return out

/-- The union of the axiom closures of `names`, in ONE traversal.

ONE traversal is not an optimisation, it is what makes the scan terminate.
`Lean.collectAxioms` starts from an empty `visited` set on every call, so
calling it per declaration re-walks the shared Mathlib closure from scratch each
time: at Lean 4.24.0 that is 88 seconds for 400 theorems, and the full
8111-constant run dies with SIGBUS having produced no output.  A scan that
crashes reports nothing, and nothing is indistinguishable from clean unless the
exit status is read.

Threading one `CollectAxioms.State` through every root makes the walk linear in
the union of the closures.  The `visited` set is what does it, and it is also
why this cannot attribute an axiom to a declaration: once a constant is visited
for one root, later roots reaching it add nothing.  Attribution is `witnessesOf`
below, and it runs only when there is something to attribute. -/
def unionOfClosures (env : Environment) (names : Array Name) : Array Name :=
  let st := names.foldl
    (fun st n ↦ (((CollectAxioms.collect n).run env).run st).2)
    ({} : CollectAxioms.State)
  st.axioms

/-- User-authored declarations that directly introduce or use `target`.

`unionOfClosures` already answers the transitive question once.  Attribution
must not call `collectAxioms` again for each root: doing so re-walked Mathlib
forty times whenever `sorryAx` was present and turned a seconds-scale audit into
a fourteen-minute job.  A direct occurrence names the actual debtor.  An axiom
is included by its own name; an admission is included where the elaborated
proof term contains `sorryAx`.  Downstream consumers remain transitively marked
by Lean's ordinary `#print axioms` semantics, but are not mislabeled as forty
separate admissions. -/
def directDebtorsOf (env : Environment) (names : Array Name) (target : Name) :
    Array Name := Id.run do
  let mut out := #[]
  for n in names do
    if n == target then
      out := out.push n
      continue
    let some ci := env.find? n | continue
    let some value := ci.value? | continue
    if value.getUsedConstants.contains target then out := out.push n
  return out

end Axioms

/-! ## LAUNDERING — the premises the kernel sees

Report, for every user-authored `Calibrator` declaration, the premises the KERNEL sees,
and fail on the ones that make a theorem's name a claim its type does not support.

The patterns below all have a CLEAN axiom report, which is why the AXIOMS scan cannot
see them: none is a trust bypass.  They are valid proofs of a weaker, conditional,
vacuous, or circular statement, checked correctly and then advertised under the intended
theorem's name.  `theorem P_from_P (h : P) : P := h` has a clean `#print axioms`.

This is the elaborated-telescope half of the guard.  `check.py` is the source-text
half, and four things only this half can see:

  * a premise from an `export`ed or `open`ed instance, which appears in no binder;
  * the `variable` binders Lean actually inserted -- it includes a section variable only
    when the declaration mentions it, so the source line over-reports;
  * a definition that unfolds to something other than its written form;
  * whether a structure parameter's type is inhabited, which needs a search for a term of
    that type rather than a name lookup.

WHAT IS REPORTED

  LAUNDER_TAUTOLOGY   the conclusion is syntactically one of the premises: `P → P`
                      under a name that claims `P`.
  LAUNDER_DEFEQ_BRIDGE a premise and conclusion become equal only after unfolding.
                      Reported, not fatal: named representation bridges are useful.
  LAUNDER_PROJECTION  the proof term, after stripping lambdas, is a projection or
                      application of a bound premise.  Reported for review; not fatal
                      by itself because elimination and representation lemmas have
                      exactly this proof shape.
  LAUNDER_CERT        a corpus-defined parameter structure has Prop-valued fields and
                      the environment holds no closed term of that type.  Reported for
                      review, not fatal by shape alone: model domains and algebraic
                      interfaces also package laws in Prop-valued fields.  The source
                      guard separately rejects advertised theorem carriers.
  LAUNDER_PREMISE     a hidden Prop-valued premise (implicit, strict implicit, or instance).
                      All Prop premises still contribute to `LAUNDER_PREMISES`; ordinary
                      explicit side conditions are aggregated rather than printed thousands
                      of times.
  LAUNDER_EMPTY       a parameter type proved uninhabited, or `Empty` / `PEmpty` / `Fin 0`.
  LAUNDER_ASSUMPTION  an instance premise of class `Fact`, `Nonempty` or `Inhabited`:
                      assumptions in instance syntax.

A `sorry` is preferred to every one of these.  `sorryAx` is visible to the AXIOMS scan;
a laundered premise is visible to neither guard nor reader.

`hasWitness S` used to walk `env.constants` for each `S` it was asked about.
The environment holds the whole of Mathlib, and the walk runs

(structures asked about) x (constants in Mathlib) x (one telescope each).

That cost was invisible while `S.mk.inj` was passing the generated-declaration
filter: the scan reached the 100-error ceiling and exited long before it had
asked about many structures. With the filter corrected the scan runs to the end
of the corpus, and at that point it does not finish inside fifteen minutes.

One pass, building the set. The predicate is unchanged: a closed term of `S ..`,
or a proof of `Nonempty (S ..)`, with no `Prop` argument in its telescope --
a witness that itself needs a hypothesis discharged is not a closed term. Thus
this distinguishes structures the corpus constructs from structures it only

/-! ## INFLATION — theorems whose proof is their own assumed hypothesis

WHY THIS IS A LEAN METAPROGRAM AND NOT A GREP.  The question is what a proof
TERM is, and that is only visible after elaboration.  Three separate text scans
of this same question gave 2, 16 and 3 hits with no overlap in names, and one of
them reported a word out of a docstring as a theorem.  The environment cannot
make that mistake: a theorem is a `thmInfo`, its proof is an `Expr`, and a field
access is a projection whether it was written `S.barrier`, `S.1`, or reached
through dot notation.

Writes `proofs/validation/code/results/inflation.json`: every hit by name,
untruncated, stamped with the revision it was measured at.  Read that file
rather than a commit message.  The 12/354/2 figures quoted for this tool were

Enumerated from the elaborated environment rather than from source text.

anchored one misses `rfl` on its own line, and a block splitter trips on a `:=`
inside the statement.  Lean is whitespace-insensitive and its proofs are not a
regular language; the environment is the only authority.

Writes `proofs/validation/code/results/rfl.json`: every hit by name and module,
stamped with the revision it was measured at.  Read that file, not a commit
message.  The "8 of 8 classified" quoted for this scan was measured with a

/-! ## JUNK — definitions that can return a totality artifact and never say so

Mathlib totalises partial operations: `x / 0 = 0`, `Real.log 0 = 0`,
`Real.sqrt x = 0` for `x < 0`, `x⁻¹` at `0`.  A definition built from these
returns a number at every point of its type, and at some of those points the
number is the convention showing through rather than the modelled quantity.
Nothing errors, nothing is flagged, and the value is usually in range.

The corpus convention is to NAME such a branch: a theorem stating what the
definition returns there, with a docstring saying what the quantity actually
does at that point and what consumers must require.  See
`stabilizingNsFromObservedCorrelation_perfect_is_junk`.

WHY THIS SCAN IS HERE AND NOT IN PYTHON.  `junk_gap.py` reads source text and is
blind to aliasing.  Twice during this corpus's development a deduplication pass
rewrote `bitSign := ![-1, 1]` to `bitSign := driftFieldB`, and the text scan
stopped seeing a vector literal it had been matching on.  This scan reads the
elaborated environment, so an alias, an abbreviation and a literal are the same
expression to it.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO.  It cannot decide REACHABILITY -- whether the junk point lies
inside the definition's admissible box.  That is the three-part test in
`proofs/validation/empirical/invariants/totality.py`, and it is undecidable in
general.  So this scan enforces the weaker, checkable contract: every definition
that CAN reach a junk value either names the branch or appears in `exempt` with
a reason.  A definition whose guard provably cannot vanish is not a defect, and
saying so in `exempt` is the whole cost of clearing it.
-/

namespace Junk

/-- The totalised partial operations, each paired with the position of the
operand that can reach its junk point.

The position differs per operation: `HDiv.hDiv` and `Inv.inv` are
heterogeneous-operation classes carrying type and instance arguments ahead of
the values, while `Real.log` and `Real.sqrt` take their argument first.

ONE LIST, NOT TWO. This was previously a bare list of the four names alongside a
separate per-operation `match` in `riskyHere` that recovered the positions, and
the list was read by nothing. That arrangement has a silent false negative in
it: adding a fifth totalised operation to the documented list changes no
behaviour, so the scan goes on reporting a clean corpus for an operation it
never looks at, and the list -- being the part a reader checks -- says
otherwise. `riskyHere` now reads this table, so an operation is scanned exactly
when it is listed here. -/

both take `∀ y, 0 < transportMass P population y` -- and a version that looked
only at the head of each binder type saw a `forallE` there and missed them. Those

misses `h_k : 0 < k` and `h_variances : ∀ i, 0 < variances i`, which are just as
binding. A definition taking such a structure cannot reach its junk point however
it is called: `EvolutionaryParameters` carries `Ne_pos`, so `fstDriftMigration`
never divides by zero.

/-! ## UNUSED: a hypothesis no proof term mentions

A Prop binder whose bound variable occurs neither in the rest of the theorem's
TYPE nor in the rest of its kernel-accepted proof VALUE is a binder the theorem
does not need.  That does not make the theorem false -- it makes it *weaker*
than it reads, and it misdescribes what the result depends on.  Three shapes
turned up the first time this ran:

  * a modelling premise nobody uses.  Three of `FoldedSpectrum`'s
    identifiability results took an `InLinkageEquilibrium` premise, and a joint
    genotype distribution as a parameter purely to state it, while the proofs
    are functions of the panel's frequencies and weights alone.  The signature
    advertised a scope limit the results do not have.
  * an instance binder narrower than the upstream lemma.  `integrable_prod_mul`
    was `Integrable.mul_prod` with two unused `SigmaFinite` instances attached;
    their deadness is precisely the evidence that the corpus copy was less
    general than the Mathlib original it duplicated.
  * a conclusion that is a hypothesis in heavier notation.  Five dead premises
    on `am_ld_breaks_cross_population` were the tell: after the shared term
    cancels, the inequality IS the premise `r_t < r_s`.

**Severity, and why it is split on the binder name.**  Some unused hypotheses
are deliberate and are the point of the theorem --
`imitable_despite_positive_pcCorrectabilityMargin` exhibits a premise that does
NOT help, and `recurrence_matching_leaves_fourth_cycle_density_free_of_palindromic_pair`
shows that matching recurrence preserves nothing.  Lean already has a
convention for "unused on purpose": the leading underscore, which is what its
own `unusedVariables` linter respects.  So a dead binder is FATAL when its name
does not begin with `_`, and reported without failing when it does.  That keeps
the gate at budget zero without an allow-list, and it makes the underscore an
admission a reader can grep for rather than a way around the check.

**The known blind spot, stated because a gate that hides one is worse than no
gate.**  `omega`, `linarith` and `simp_all` splice every hypothesis in scope
into the certificate they emit, so a hypothesis they did not need still occurs
in the term.  This scan cannot see those, `Calibrator.ZZCalib.zz_unused_tac` is
the committed proof that it cannot, and `UNUSED_FATAL` is therefore a lower
bound.  There is no false-positive direction: occurrence-freedom in a term the
kernel accepted is a proof that the binder is deletable.

**Validity.**  The result is computed against the statement as it stands in this
environment, so it expires whenever a statement changes.  That is automatic
here, since the scan reruns from the built corpus on every invocation; the type
hash is reported alongside each finding so an out-of-band record of one can be
checked against the declaration it was computed from.

/-! ## Calibration of the UNUSED scan

An uncalibrated detector is worse than no detector: this corpus has already had
four laundering families sit silently dead until a calibration was written for
them.  So the unused-binder scan is checked against declarations with known
answers BEFORE it is run over the corpus, and a calibration failure is a
`logError` like any other -- the detector gates on its own calibration.

These live in the `Check.Calib` namespace rather than in a `Calibrator` module
on purpose.  `Check.isOurs` keys on the name root, so the corpus scan does not
see them, and planting a deliberately defective theorem inside `Calibrator` to
test a corpus gate would put a defect in the corpus to check for defects.

Both directions are asserted, and so is the KNOWN MISS.  If a future change
made the scan see through `omega`, `calib_unused_tac` would start being
reported and this calibration would fail -- which is correct: that is a
behaviour change in a gate, and it should be noticed and the expectation
updated deliberately rather than absorbed silently.

/-! ## Driver

One `run_cmd` for all four scans.  They share the environment traversal cost and,
more importantly, they share the declaration filter: running them as four
separate files is how the filter came to have three disagreeing copies.

`logError` is what makes the run exit nonzero, so it marks offences only.
Everything else is `logInfo` or `IO.println`.
