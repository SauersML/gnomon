"""Mutation-test the guard calibration: if a guard goes blind, does anyone notice?

    python3 proofs/validation/code/mutate_guards.py

STATUS: DIAGNOSTIC.  Not a CI step -- it runs `test_check.py` once per guard,
so it is roughly ten times the cost of the gated calibration.  Run it when a
guard is added, renamed, or substantially rewritten.

WHAT IT ASKS, AND WHY IT IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION.  `test_check.py` plants
defects in fixture corpora and asserts each is reported.  That establishes the
suite catches those defects; it does not establish WHICH guard caught them.  A
guard whose planted defects are also reported by a neighbour looks calibrated
and is not: it could stop working entirely and the calibration would stay
green.

So: neuter each `run_<guard>()` in `check.py` -- make it return 0 immediately,
emitting no findings -- and re-run `test_check.py` against the unmodified
fixtures.  A guard whose calibration still passes while the guard reports
nothing is UNCALIBRATED.

This found exactly one on 2026-08-04: `mathlib`, the guard that proves the
corpus does not duplicate Mathlib, could be silenced entirely with no effect on
`test_check.py`.  `check.mathlib_root()` had honoured `GNOMON_MATHLIB` "so the
guard can be calibrated against a fixture tree" since it was written -- the
hook was built and the calibration was never attached to it.  `calibrate_mathlib()`
in test_check.py now covers it, and this file is what proves that coverage is
real rather than nominal.

The mutation is applied to a throwaway copy; nothing here edits the checkout.
