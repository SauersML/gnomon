"""Stamp every artifact with where and when it came from, and check it.

An artifact at a FIXED shared path is always populated, so no consumer can tell
"this run has not written yet" from "a previous run wrote this". Existence is
not evidence of currency. My own fallback bug was the same shape one level up: a
predicate that could not be false on first use, so the run wrote beside the
source while looking compliant.

So every artifact carries, inside the file:

    _provenance: {revision, dirty, generated_utc, generator, corpus_defs, host}

and a consumer checks the REVISION rather than the file's existence. The extract
tier's staleness check was found comparing generated files against each other
and never against the Lean sources, so a coherent snapshot of a corpus that no
longer exists reported clean. Comparing against the revision the corpus was at
is what makes that detectable.

A measurement that cannot report its own absence will eventually report someone
else's answer as its own.
