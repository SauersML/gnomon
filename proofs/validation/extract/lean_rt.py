"""Lean/Mathlib-faithful runtime for extracted definitions.

Mathlib's real operations are *total*: they are given junk-but-defined values
outside their mathematical domain.  Hand transcription into Python routinely
gets this wrong (Python raises where Lean returns 0), and the difference is
exactly where a definition's edge-case behaviour lives.  These shims reproduce
Mathlib's conventions:

    x / 0        = 0            (`div_zero`)
    x⁻¹ at 0     = 0            (`inv_zero`)
    Real.log 0   = 0            (`Real.log_zero`)
    Real.log x   = log |x|      (`Real.log_neg_eq_log`)
    Real.sqrt x  = 0 for x < 0  (`Real.sqrt_eq_zero_of_nonpos`)
    x ^ (n : ℕ)  = monoid pow, 0 ^ 0 = 1
    x ^ (y : ℝ)  = Real.rpow    (0 ^ y = 0 for y ≠ 0; x < 0 uses exp/cos branch)

# A Lean value of type `Fin n → ℝ` is read in TWO different ways by the code
# this package generates:
#
#   * as a table, when the argument was declared `Fin n → ℝ` -- the translator
#     emits `v[int(i)]`, and `∑ i, v i` needs `len(v)`;
#   * as a function, when the same value arrives as a structure FIELD -- the
#     translator emits `_rt._proj(s, 'v')(i)`, because from inside a body a
#     projection is just an expression that gets applied.
#
# Handing out two different Python values for the one Lean value is what broke
# this before: `admissible.struct_value` gave function-typed fields a lambda,
# which has no length, so `∑ j, spectrum.weight j` could not run, and gave
# `Pop → Matrix …` fields a *dict* (it read the head `Pop` as a structure name),
# so `m.directCausal P` raised "'dict' object is not callable".  VecFn is ONE
# value that answers both readings, so a field and an argument of the same Lean
# type behave identically and cannot disagree.
#
# Out-of-range indexing RAISES.  It must: silently clamping or wrapping would
# turn "this definition was evaluated at an index its argument does not have"
# into a plausible number, and that number would become evidence.
