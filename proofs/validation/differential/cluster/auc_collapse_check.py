"""Collapse detector for the AUC family: which of these names are one function?

WHY THIS EXISTS
    Four names in this family denoted one bit-identical function, and the
    consequence was not cosmetic: each name carried its own tests, so ONE
    function was validated four times and counted as four. A theorem was then
    stated across two of those names and proved by `rfl` -- `f x = f x` wearing
    two names -- while reading as "AUC is preserved under equal drift".

    Nothing in the corpus's instruments could see that. A range check confirms
    the output is a probability; it cannot notice that two probabilities are the
    same probability by construction. This script is the missing instrument, and
    it takes seconds.

METHOD
    Evaluate every definition of matching arity at random admissible points and
    report any pair whose maximum absolute spread is exactly zero. Bit-identical
    output across a random box is not proof of definitional equality, but it is
    the cheap screen that catches the case before someone writes a theorem on it.

THE TRAP THIS SCRIPT IS BUILT TO AVOID
    `equalVarianceGaussianAUCChart` is `if 1 <= r2 then 1 else
    equalVarianceGaussianAUCFromExplainedR2 r2`. On the interior it IS the other
    function, so a checker sampling only `r2 in [0,1)` reports a collapse that is
    not there and would demand a fix that destroys a deliberate boundary
    extension. The r2 grid below therefore straddles `r2 = 1` on purpose.

    This is the same discipline as putting a witness inside the excepted set: a
    difference that exists only on a boundary is invisible to any sample that
    avoids the boundary.
