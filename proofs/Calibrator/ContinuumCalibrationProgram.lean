# Resolving the drifting index: strata, gauge, unqueried populations, and decisions

`Calibrator.ContinuumCalibration` fixes one predictor class and answers the first question about
a family of populations whose conditional risk moves along the family: index-wise calibration
energy is aggregate energy plus an irreducible drift defect, the posterior mean attains the
defect, and the two demands are nested rather than opposed.

This module continues from there, and every result below is a finite, exactly stated face of a
step in that program.  Nothing analytic is assumed: no disintegration, no singular-value
asymptotics, no minimax rate over a smoothness class.  Where the continuum statement is a limit,
what is proved here is the identity the limit is taken of.

* **One lemma.**  Weights on a carrier, a partition into cells, a representative per cell: if the
  weighted residual sums to zero inside every cell, the residual is orthogonal to everything the
  cells can see.  Everything below is that fact instantiated -- in the index direction (ancestry
  strata) and in the covariate direction (the reported score's bins).

* **Stratified resolution.**  A recalibration allowed to depend on an ancestry stratum, an
  environment, or a study is a predictor factoring through `stratify : Index → Stratum`.  The
  cell lemma gives the whole geometry: an exact Pythagoras against every competing
  stratum-measurable predictor, the optimality of the stratum-calibrated one, and the exact
  decrement obtained by refining the stratification.  The energy the refinement removes is
  exactly the between-stratum drift it resolves.

* **Nested demands.**  A stratum-calibrated recalibration is automatically calibrated in
  aggregate: its calibration-in-the-large is exactly zero.  Ancestry-specific calibration is
  never bought at the pooled model's expense.

* **Refining the report.**  In the covariate direction the same monotonicity says that a sharper
  reported score exposes weakly more population drift, and conversely.  Sharpness and exposed
  defect are one functional evaluated on two fields.

* **Worst population versus pooled.**  In the squared posterior geometry there is nothing to
  trade.  The applied tension lives in the worst-population norm, whose optimum is the midrange:
  it disagrees with the pooled, aggregate-calibrated report exactly when representation is
  unequal, and the gap does not close with more data.

* **Complementarity, hence co-monotonicity.**  Residual and resolution sum to the drift defect
  of `ContinuumCalibration`.  So resolution cannot be bought without paying the defect down by
  the same amount, and refining strata moves both by exactly one shared quantity.  This is the
  calibration--refinement trade-off as an identity rather than a tension.

* **The gauge obstruction.**  Two conditional fields with the *same* values in the same
  multiplicities, differing only in which index carries which value, have equal drift defect and
  unequal within-stratum residual.  So no functional of the field's law can predict what a
  prescribed stratification recovers: alignment between the stratification and the drift decides
  it, and alignment is not a property of the field alone.

* **Unqueried populations.**  Two conditional fields that agree at every observed index, carry
  the same posterior mean, and have the same index-wise energy against *every* predictor, can
  differ by the full drift width at an unobserved index.  No estimator separates them, so the
  best available error at an unqueried population is the drift radius, and the posterior mean
  attains it.  Extrapolation across a family whose marginals do not move buys exactly nothing.

* **Decisions.**  A drifting risk that straddles a clinical threshold has a strictly positive
  net-benefit cost that no single ancestry-blind action avoids, and the cost is computed in
  closed form in the units of `decisionCurveNetBenefit`.  A drift that stays on one side of
  the threshold costs nothing at all: that is exactly which losses survive the drift.

* **Allocation.**  Stratifying into `k` cells and estimating each from `n_s` samples pays an
  effective stratum count that is at least `k`, with equality exactly at balanced allocation, and
  a two-term budget whose optimum sits where the two terms balance.

The biological wiring is by theorem, not by prose: `stratifiedCalibrationEnergy` is related to
`indexWiseCalibrationEnergy` and `calibrationDriftDefectSq`, the decision results are stated in
the units of `decisionCurveNetBenefit` and agree with `thresholdDecision`, and the aggregate
moment is identified with `calibrationInTheLarge`.

/-! ## The one lemma: cellwise balance is orthogonality to everything the cells can see

Every decomposition in this module is an instance of a single finite fact.  Weights on a carrier,
a partition of the carrier into cells, and a representative value per cell: if the weighted
residual sums to zero inside every cell, then the residual is orthogonal to every function
constant on cells.  Instantiated in the index direction the cells are ancestry strata; in the
covariate direction they are the level sets of the reported score.  The two readings of the
calibration--refinement trade-off below are the same theorem twice.

/-! ## Refining the reported score: sharpness and exposed drift rise together

The other reading of the same lemma.  Here the cells are the level sets of the reported score --
the bins a calibration plot is drawn on -- and the carrier is the covariate.  Refining those bins
is what "reporting a sharper score" means.  Two consequences, both monotone and both instances of
`cellBalanced_representative_energy_le_of_refine`: a finer report resolves weakly more of the
pooled signal (sharpness), and weakly more of every population's drift away from the pooled
conditional (exposed defect).  A predictor cannot become sharper without exposing more of the
drift, which is the calibration--refinement trade-off in the direction the applied literature
reports it.  Nothing here is a rate: the finite statement is that the two move together.

/-! ## Worst population versus pooled: the tension is in the norm, not in the demands

In the squared, posterior-weighted geometry there is nothing to trade -- that is the content of
the complementarity above.  The tension the applied literature reports, between a pooled model
and its worst group, lives in a different norm: the worst-population error.  Its minimiser is the
midrange of the population risks, while pooled calibration forces the posterior mean, and those
two agree only under equal representation.  So the pooled-versus-worst-group gap is a statement
about the choice of norm across populations, not about calibration being in conflict with itself.

/-! ## The gauge obstruction: the law of the drift does not decide what strata recover

The index labels are not observable; only the family is.  So a quantity that changes when the
labels are permuted, holding the family fixed, is not a property of the biology.  The witness
below is the smallest one: four populations, two strata, and two conditional fields taking the
same two values in the same multiplicities.  They have equal pooled drift defect and unequal
within-stratum residual, which settles the question negatively -- what a prescribed
stratification recovers is decided by its alignment with the drift, and alignment is not a
functional of the drift's law.

size of a portability gap says nothing about whether stratifying by ancestry will close it; only
the alignment between the strata and the drift decides that, and it must be measured. -/

/-! ## Unqueried populations: the drift radius is the whole answer

The construction is the two-point one.  Two populations carry the same covariate distribution --
this is the pure posterior-drift regime, where the index has no observable signature -- and two
candidate conditional fields assign the same pair of risks to them in opposite orders.  Every
posterior-weighted functional of the two is identical, so no amount of data from elsewhere
separates them; yet at either population they differ by the full drift width.

/-! ## Decisions: which losses survive the drift, in net-benefit units

`ContinuumCalibration` shows that a threshold crossing leaves no single correct action.  What is
proved here is the price, in the units the clinical literature already uses: the net benefit of
`decisionCurveNetBenefit`.  A drift that crosses the threshold costs a strictly positive,
closed-form amount whatever single action is taken; a drift that stays on one side costs zero.
That dichotomy is the survival criterion for decision losses: a loss survives a drifting
conditional exactly when its threshold is outside the drift's range.
