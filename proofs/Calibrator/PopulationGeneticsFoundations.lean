# Population Genetics Foundations for PGS Portability

This file formalizes the core population genetics theory underlying
PGS portability: allele frequency dynamics, Fst computation, coalescent
theory, and the relationship between demographic history and genetic
differentiation.

Key results:
1. Fst definitions and properties (Nei, Hudson, simplified)
2. Coalescent theory and expected heterozygosity
3. Effective population size and drift
4. Wright's fixation indices
5. Mutation-drift balance (equilibrium and transient Fst, LD decay)

Provenance: derived here, not imported. Wang et al. (2026), Nature Communications 17:942,
substantiates nothing below. It is an empirical study of the polygenic-score portability
gap and does not treat Fst estimators, coalescent theory or mutation-drift balance.
Sources for individual results, where they exist, are cited at those results.

## Fst Definitions and Properties

Fst measures genetic differentiation between populations.
Multiple definitions exist, all related but not identical.
-/

section FstDefinitions

/-- **Nei's Fst.**
    Fst = (H_T - H_S) / H_T where H_T is total heterozygosity
    and H_S is mean subpopulation heterozygosity.

    Regime: a clean two-population split, no migration, equal sizes; both
    heterozygosities as ratios of averages over segregating sites.

    Empirical status: **MEASURED, and NOT interchangeable with Hudson's
    `F_ST`** (`simcov/battery_bulk25.py`). This body is an identity in `H_T` and
    `H_S`, so comparing it against a transcription of itself decides nothing.
    What a simulation can decide is whether it obeys the split law
    `τ/(1+τ)` that the rest of this corpus writes `F_ST` results in. It does
    not. Over `τ` = 0.1, 0.25, 1, 3 the split law predicts 0.09091, 0.20000,
    0.50000 and 0.75000, while Nei's estimator on the same genotype matrices
    measures 0.05495 ± 0.00453, 0.11904 ± 0.00513, 0.34185 ± 0.00851 and
    0.61182 ± 0.00905 -- FALSIFIED at up to 18.59 sems, low in every cell.

    The control is what makes this a statement about the CONVENTION rather than
    about the simulation: Hudson's estimator, computed from the SAME genotype
    matrices through a separate code path, matches the same split law at 0.03
    sems. One design, one dataset, two estimators, and only one of them follows
    the law. So the oracle is not pinned to either body, and the discrepancy is
    the convention gap and not an artefact.

    The ratio `neiGst / hudsonFst` is not a constant either -- it runs 0.62,
    0.60, 0.68, 0.81 across that sweep -- so no fixed factor converts between
    them and a `1/2` or `1/4` correction is not available. Every `F_ST` result
    in this corpus stated as `τ/(1+τ)`, or derived from it, is a HUDSON result;
    substituting this body into one of them is the factor-of-two-to-four error
    the corpus has already paid for once. -/

/-- **Nei's `Fst` is a proportion of total heterozygosity, pinned.** This definition carries no
result of its own. Subpopulations holding half the total heterozygosity give `Fst = 1/2`: the
deficit is measured against the total, not against the subpopulation value, and it runs total
minus subpopulation so that structure raises it. -/

/-- **Nei's `G_ST` for two equally weighted subgroups, from allele
    frequencies:** `G_ST = (p₁ - p₂)² / (4·p̄·(1-p̄))`.

    THIRD COPY, CORRECTLY NAMED, DO NOT DELETE ON DISCOVERY. This is algebraically
    identical to `Conventions.neiGst`, which is written in the heterozygosity form
    `1 - (p₁(1-p₁) + p₂(1-p₂))/(2·p̄(1-p̄))`. The two agree because
    `p₁(1-p₁) + p₂(1-p₂) = 2p̄(1-p̄) - (p₁-p₂)²/2`, so
    `1 - H_S/H_T = (p₁-p₂)²/(4p̄(1-p̄))` exactly; `Conventions.neiGst_eq_varianceRatio`
    relates the two shapes. A name audit checked both against Nei's definition and
    found both correct, so if a duplication scan reports this pair, the resolution is
    to repoint one at the other, NOT to delete whichever is found second -- and note
    that `Conventions.hudsonFst` is a genuinely different estimator that only looks
    like a third spelling of the same thing.

    This is Nei's `G_ST` -- `1 - H_S/H_T` with `H_T = 2p̄(1-p̄)`
    the total-pool heterozygosity and `H_S` the mean within-subgroup
    heterozygosity -- and it is NOT Hudson's `F_ST`, which divides instead by
    the between-subgroup heterozygosity `p₁(1-p₂) + p₂(1-p₁)`. Derivation:
    `H_T - H_S = 2p̄(1-p̄) - (p₁(1-p₁) + p₂(1-p₂)) = (p₁-p₂)²/2`, and dividing
    by `H_T` gives this body. Hudson's estimator lives in `Conventions` as
    `hudsonFst`, with the exact conversion `Hudson = 2·G/(1 + G)` proved as
    `Conventions.hudsonFst_eq_of_neiGst`. The two differ by up to a factor
    of two -- +71.4% at `p₁ = 0.2, p₂ = 0.6` -- and AGREE ONLY WHERE THIS
    QUANTITY IS `0` OR `1`, i.e. at `p₁ = p₂` or at complete differentiation.
    That is immediate from the conversion: `2·G/(1+G) = G` iff `G = 0` or
    `G = 1`.

    **There is no `p̄ = 1/2` agreement slice. Do not add one.**
    On `p̄ = 1/2` exactly, with `p₁ = 0.9, p₂ = 0.1`, this body gives `0.64`
    and Hudson gives `0.7805`, a ratio of `1.22`; toward the middle the ratio
    approaches `2` (`1.995` at `(0.525, 0.475)`). The trap is that `p̄ = 1/2`
    makes the denominator `4·p̄·(1-p̄)` equal `1`, which looks like it should
    settle the comparison — it only makes `G_ST = (p₁-p₂)²`, while Hudson
    still divides by `1 - 2·p₁·p₂`.

    The arithmetic is unchanged by the rename; only the claim about what the
    number is has been made explicit.

    Empirical status: CONVENTION PINNED as Nei's `G_ST`, confirmed against an
    independent implementation by the differential checks `simpleFst-is-nei`
    and `simpleFst-vs-hudson`, which are retained as the standing checks. -/

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_fix.py`,
    `test_fst_composition`). msprime coalescent simulation of a clean split with
    no migration, ancestral and both daughter sizes `Ne = 1000`, recombining at
    `1e-8` so a replicate carries many independent genealogies, Hudson `F_ST` as
    a ratio of averages, 25 replicates of 20 Mb, 50 diploids per deme:

      t        this def    simulated             sems
       500       0.20000   0.19923±0.00227     0.34

      2000       0.50000   0.49974±0.00330     0.08

    Recombination is not optional in this design. At `recombination_rate = 0`
    every site in a replicate sits on ONE genealogy, so a 20 Mb sequence carries
    no more information about `F_ST` than a single site; two runs of this same
    demography then differed by 2.4 sems and neither error bar was usable.

    On these same runs `pairwiseFstFromBranchTaus` -- the sibling composition
    that sums both branch taus -- errs by 51 to 59 sems, and is falsified there.

    Regime: symmetric split. This definition takes a single `Ne` and so says
    nothing about unequal daughter sizes; substituting a harmonic mean for an
    asymmetric split misses by 4.6 sems and is not a reading this definition
    offers.

## Selection-Migration Balance

When natural selection acts in the presence of migration,
a balance is reached that determines the amount of differentiation
at selected loci.
-/

section SelectionMigrationBalance

/-- One generation of continent--island dynamics, selection step first: the
locally favoured allele at frequency `p` is reweighted by relative fitness
`1 + s`, then a fraction `m` of the island is replaced by continental migrants
carrying the allele at frequency zero.

Convention: selection precedes migration within a generation. The orderings are
not interchangeable -- they have different fixed points, and deterministic
iteration separates them at the fourth decimal -- so the ordering is part of the
model rather than part of the presentation.  The other order is
`continentIslandStepMigrationFirst`, and `selectionMigrationEquilibrium_orderings`
relates the two.

    Empirical status: VALIDATED (deterministic iteration reproduces the fixed
    point to all digits reported, s = 0.1 m = 0.05 -> 0.45000).

    Power: iterated over the four cells `(s, m) = (.1, .05), (.1, .08), (.1, .1),
    (.2, .4)` this map rests at `0.45000`, `0.12000`, `0` and `0`, so the design
    spans the maintained regime and the absorbing one. The migration-first
    ordering rests at `0.47368` and `0.13043` on the first two of those cells,
    which is the separation that makes the convention checkable rather than
    stylistic. -/

over. Lean returns `0`, an ordinary post-selection frequency, and the extinction is not

/-- **Selection-migration equilibrium frequency** under the selection-first

This closed form is not stipulated.  It is the nonzero solution of
`continentIslandStepSelectionFirst s m p = p`, and
`selectionMigrationEquilibrium_isFixedPoint` is the theorem that pins it: no
other constant can be substituted here and still compile.  The `max` is not
cosmetic either.  Migration is absorbing: once `m (1 + s) ≥ s` the allele is
lost outright and the equilibrium is the boundary value `0`, which
`selectionMigrationEquilibrium_eq_zero` records and
`continentIslandStep_zero` confirms is itself a fixed point.

    Empirical status: VALIDATED (0.45000, 0.12000, 0, 0 against iteration at
    (s, m) = (.1, .05), (.1, .08), (.1, .1), (.2, .4)).

    Power: the prediction spans `0.45000` down to `0` across those four cells,
    crossing the absorbing boundary within the design, so the `max` and the
    interior formula are both exercised. The migration-first closed form gives
    `0.47368` and `0.13043` where this one gives `0.45000` and `0.12000`, so the
    check also separates the two orderings. -/

the lower end and lets the degeneracy through it. Consumers must exclude it by hypothesis. -/

/-- The equilibrium under the migration-first convention.

Derived, not stipulated, in the same way as its companion:
`selectionMigrationEquilibriumMigrationFirst_isFixedPoint` proves it is the
nonzero solution of `continentIslandStepMigrationFirst s m p = p`, and the
`max 0` carries the same absorbing boundary, since migration swamps selection
under either ordering.

    Empirical status: VALIDATED (iteration gives 0.47368 at s = 0.1, m = 0.05,
    matching this closed form; the selection-first convention rests at 0.45000
    on the same parameters, which is the composition convention showing up in
    the fourth decimal).

    Power: across `(s, m) = (.1, .05), (.1, .08), (.1, .1), (.2, .4)` this form
    predicts `0.47368`, `0.13043`, `0` and `0`, spanning the maintained regime

## Wright's Fixation Indices

Wright's F-statistics partition genetic variation into hierarchical
levels: individual, subpopulation, total.

  1 - (1 - f_IS) * (1 - f_ST)

/-- **Wright's `F_IT` compounds the two levels, pinned.** The identity with
`pairwiseFstFromBranches` constrains the two definitions jointly and leaves a shared wrong factor
free. Two independent halves compound to three quarters, not to one -- the inbreeding
coefficients multiply as retained heterozygosities rather than adding. -/
theorem wrightFIT_compounds_two_halves :
    wrightFIT (1 / 2) (1 / 2) = 3 / 4 := by
  unfold wrightFIT
  norm_num

/-- Wright's decomposition identity. -/
theorem wright_decomposition (f_IS f_ST : ℝ) :
    wrightFIT f_IS f_ST = f_IS + f_ST - f_IS * f_ST := by
  unfold wrightFIT; ring

/-- **The multiplicative-complement composition `1 - (1-a)(1-b)` occurs twice, and the two
occurrences do not have the same status.**

`wrightFIT` composes `F_IS` with `F_ST` across *nested* levels — individual within
subpopulation within total — and there the composition is exact, because the two
complements are the retention factors of a genuine hierarchy.
`PortabilityDrift.pairwiseFstFromBranches` applies the same algebra to two *sibling*
branches, and `PortabilityDrift` records it as CONDITIONALLY VALID for exactly that
reason: composing multiplicatively in `F_ST` inserts a spurious `tauS * tauT` of divergence
time, because coalescence times add along a path while `F_ST` values do not, and near
`tau = 1` that term doubles the divergence time.

So the shared body is not a coincidence and not an identification either: it is one
algebraic move that is *correct across levels and wrong across branches*.  This theorem
exists so the arithmetic agreement is on the record and cannot drift, and so that anyone
repairing one of the two is forced to look at the other. `pairwiseFstFromBranchTaus` is the
composition PortabilityDrift offers in place of the branch case. -/

/-- **Within-population heterozygosity loss after `t` generations of drift.**
    `1 - (1 - 1/(2 Nₑ))^t`.

    **This is *not* between-population `F_ST` after a split.** Coalescent simulation with
    branch-mode
    divergence, which removes mutational noise analytically, shows the split
    quantity is `coalFst t Ne = t / (t + 2 Nₑ)`: that is unbiased across the
    tested grid, while this formula is biased upward in eleven of twelve cells
    by up to 28 percent. The formula is correct for what it now says, and
    `heterozygosityLossDerived_eq_het_loss` is the theorem that says it; only the name and
    docstring were reassigning it to a different observable.

    Regime: closed population, no mutation. See `Calibrator.DriftRegime`.

    Empirical status: VALIDATED as heterozygosity loss against the drift-only
    recurrence it restates (0.9048/0.6065/0.1353 retention at t = 200/1000/4000
    with Ne = 1000); FALSIFIED as split `F_ST`, and FALSIFIED as *measured*
    heterozygosity loss at mutation-drift balance, where the simulated retention
    is 1.025 ± 0.02 at every one of those times. The first clause is an identity
    and carries no empirical weight on its own — a cross-check cannot measure the
    premise it shares, `DriftRegime.crossChecks_blind_to_retention`.

    Denotes: within-population heterozygosity loss. The same formula appears under
    `heterozygosityLossFromDrift` here and `founderHeterozygosityLoss` in
    `DemographicHistory`; all three now name the quantity rather than leaving the
    formula to fix it, which it cannot.

    Power: the retention this formula predicts spans `0.9048`, `0.6065` and
    `0.1353` at `t = 200`, `1000` and `4000` with `Ne = 1000` — nearly the whole
    unit interval — while the measurement at mutation-drift balance stays at
    `1.025` across all three times. The design therefore has the power to
    separate the two regimes, which is how the falsification was reached. -/

## Mutation-Drift Balance

When mutation is non-negligible, Fst reaches a finite equilibrium instead
of going to 1. The classic Wright result gives Fst = 1/(1 + 4Neμ).
Mutation also governs equilibrium heterozygosity via θ = 4Neμ.

Time in units of `2 Nₑ` generations. On that timescale a lineage pair coalesces

`θ = 4 Nₑ μ` for mutation, `M = 4 Nₑ m` for migration, and the *sum* when both
act, which is the reason the two scaled rates add rather than compose.

Composition convention: the balance is written in scaled time, so no
within-generation ordering enters and the map is the same under either. The
per-generation maps, where the ordering does matter, are `ibdFlowStep` and
`ibdRecurrenceStep` in `Calibrator.PortabilityDrift`; this one is their

/-- **Complementarity of heterozygosity and Fst under mutation-drift balance.**

    **Biological derivation.** Nei's Fst is *defined* as the proportion of total
    heterozygosity that is due to between-population differences:

      Fst = (H_T − H_S) / H_T = 1 − H_S / H_T

    where H_T is total (meta-population) heterozygosity and H_S is the mean
    subpopulation heterozygosity. Rearranging gives

      H_S / H_T  +  Fst  =  1

    so the within-population share and the between-population share of genetic
    diversity are complementary *by definition* of Fst as a variance partition.

    At mutation-drift equilibrium under the infinite-alleles model,
    H_S / H_T = θ/(1+θ) = `expectedHeterozygosity θ` and
    Fst = 1/(1+θ) = `fstMutationDriftEquilibrium θ`.  The algebraic identity
    θ/(1+θ) + 1/(1+θ) = 1 is therefore the equilibrium instantiation of the
    definitional partition H_S/H_T + Fst = 1.

    See also `nei_fst_complement` for the general (non-equilibrium)
    version derived directly from Nei's definition, and
    `nei_fst_equilibrium_consistent` which connects the two. -/

    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk16.py`). Infinite-alleles
    Wright-Fisher started ALL-DISTINCT -- every chromosome carrying its own

    condition this formula assumes. 200 replicate populations, identity measured
    without replacement within the deme, at five times per parameter set
    spanning `t/Ne` from 0.25 to 4:

      Ne     theta    worst cell of five     rel err

      200    0.80     under 2 sems           under 6%

    Positive control: the plateau reproduces the independently validated
    `1/(1 + theta)`.

    Not separated from `fstMutationDriftTransientDiscrete`, and the docstring
    there says why: the two agree to O(1/Ne), the design reaches down to
    `Ne = 50` where the gap is about one percent, and the replicate noise here
    is six percent. So this validates the SHAPE of the approach -- the rate
    constant `(1 + theta)/(2 Ne)` and the equilibrium it approaches -- and does
    not discriminate continuous from discrete time. That limit is stated rather
    than papered over.

## Migration-Drift Balance: Population Genetics Foundations

The island model of migration-drift balance is a cornerstone of population genetics.
When populations exchange migrants at rate m per generation, drift and migration
reach an equilibrium Fst = 1/(1 + 4Nm). This section provides the pure population
genetics foundations for migration effects, independent of PGS portability.

Key results:
1. Island model Fst equilibrium and monotonicity properties
2. Stepping-stone model and isolation by distance
3. Migration homogenizes allele frequencies and LD
4. Admixture (recent migration pulses) and transient LD
5. Asymmetric migration and effective migration rates

/-! ### Island Model Equilibrium

**REGIME, stated once for everything in this section.** `1/(1 + 4·Nₑ·m)` is the
INFINITE-ISLAND LIMIT. It is the `d → ∞` case of the finite-island result

  `F_ST = 1 / (1 + 4·Nₑ·m·d/(d-1))`

for `d` demes, and it is not the finite-`d` answer. **This header used to quote
the SQUARED correction `(d/(d-1))²` here while `islandFstFiniteDemes` -- twenty
lines below, in this same section -- states the linear one, and the measurement
recorded on `islandDemeCorrection` excludes the square at 9.04 sems.** The two
were a straight contradiction inside one section. The linear form is the one
this corpus's `F_ST` convention has: see the attribution note on
`islandFstFiniteDemes` for which published statistic each form belongs to.

The correction factor `d/(d-1)` is `2` at `d = 2` and `1.5` at `d = 3`, so with
two demes the limit understates the migration pressure by a factor of two in
the scaled rate and overstates `F_ST` correspondingly. Nothing about the
expression `1/(1+4Nm)`
announces this, which is why every theorem below is a theorem about the limit
and not about a two-deme system. `islandFstFiniteDemes` states the finite form,
`islandFstFiniteDemes_lt_islandLimit` proves the limit is an overstatement at
every finite `d`, and `islandDemeCorrection_tendsto_one` proves the two agree
only in the limit.

The reason this matters here specifically: two-population comparisons are the
common case in this corpus, and `d = 2` is exactly where the limit is worst. -/

/-- **Finite-island correction factor** `d/(d-1)`, in the number of demes
`d`. This is the entire difference between the infinite-island limit and the
finite-island result, isolated so that it can be stated about rather than
carried implicitly.

    **The exponent was 2 and is measured to be 1.** msprime symmetric island
    model at equilibrium, `F_ST` read as `1 - E[T_within]/E[T_between]` directly
    off the genealogies -- no mutations, no estimator, no convention between the
    definition and the number. `Ne = 1000`, total emigration `m = 1e-3` so
    `4 Ne m = 4.0` is identical in every row, 40 replicates of 2 Mb:

    The squared form is low in all seven cells, which is a bias and not scatter;
    the linear form is within 2.1 sems in six of seven. Neither the deme-blind
    limit (23.8 sems at two demes) nor the square survives.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED** as `d/(d-1)`
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_max.py`, `test_island_law`),
    the square **FALSIFIED** on the same runs.

    Power: at fixed `4 Ne m` the two candidates predict 0.11111 against 0.05882
    at two demes and converge to 0.19598 against 0.19202 at forty, so the design
    separates them where they differ and not where they do not. 
    **Validated across five deme counts, and the squared form excluded**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk18b.py`). Island model with
    the TOTAL emigration rate held fixed at `4 Ne m = 2.0` while the deme count
    runs 2, 3, 5, 10, 25, `F_ST` from coalescence times so no estimator
    convention enters:

      worst cell:                  17.66 sems      2.74 sems    9.04 sems

    The linear correction is the one the data supports. The SQUARED correction
    was carried through the same cells because it is the form originally
    proposed for this defect, and it is excluded at 9.04 sems -- it overshoots
    at every deme count and worst where the correction matters most. Recording
    that is the point of having carried it: the power on this factor is settled
    by the sweep rather than by whichever form was proposed first.

    Holding the TOTAL rate fixed is what makes the sweep mean anything, and an
    earlier run of it did not. `msprime`'s `island_model(migration_rate = m)`
    sets the rate between each ORDERED PAIR, so a deme's total emigration is
    `m (n - 1)` and climbs with the deme count; a sweep at fixed pairwise rate
    moves the very quantity the formulas take, and the measured `F_ST` then
    falls for a reason no candidate is being asked about. That run is superseded
    by this one.

    The no-correction row is `fstDriftMigrationManyDemes` and the table is also
    its evidence: 17.66 sems adrift at two demes and 0.65 sems at twenty-five,
    which is what a many-deme limit should look like.

/-! **`PortabilityDrift.finiteIslandCorrection` is this same quantity written a second

Both are `d/(d-1)`, both are documented as *the* standard finite-island correction
factor in the number of demes, and both exist to isolate the entire gap between the
infinite-island limit and the finite-`d` result.  This is one quantity defined twice, not
two quantities that coincide — the failure mode this corpus already hit with three
definitions of `F_ST`, where repairing one left the other two standing.

The identity theorem was written and then withdrawn once, because `finiteIslandCorrection`
was present in `PortabilityDrift.lean`'s source but absent from its compiled `olean`, so
the statement did not elaborate against a stale build.  That was a build-cache condition,
not a defect in either definition, and it is gone: `PortabilityDrift` compiles and this
file imports it.  The withdrawal is worth recording because of *how* it failed — loudly,
and only because the statement applies the name to an argument.  A bare occurrence would
have been auto-bound as an implicit variable and stayed green, which is the hazard
`DGP.LDDecayMechanism` documents.

Stating the identity is the weaker of the two available repairs.  The stronger one is to
delete a definition and have the survivor's callers move over; that is a cross-module
rename this pass did not attempt.  What the theorem buys in the meantime is the property
the duplicate-body guard exists to enforce: if either body is edited, this line stops
compiling. -/

/-- **The two finite-island corrections are one quantity.**  `islandDemeCorrection` here
and `PortabilityDrift.finiteIslandCorrection` are both `d/(d-1)` under two names in two

compile error rather than a silent fork. -/

/-- **Finite-island `F_ST` for `d` demes**, `F_ST = 1/(1 + 4·Nₑ·m·d/(d-1))`.

    **Attribution, corrected -- this is not Nei's.** The docstring used to cite
    "(Wright; Nei)". The form with the deme factor SQUARED,
    `1/(1 + 4·Nₑ·m·(d/(d-1))²)`, is Crow and Aoki (1984) for Nei's `G_ST` and is
    what Whitlock and McCauley (1999), Heredity 82:117--125, quote; naming Nei on
    the LINEAR form credits him with the form this corpus measured against his.

    The linear form is the ratio-of-coalescence-times statistic, Slatkin (1991),
    *Inbreeding coefficients and coalescence times*, Genetics Research
    58:167--175, which finds `F_ST` in the finite island model by that route. The
    derivation is short enough to check here: in the symmetric island model
    `E[T_within] = 2·Nₑ·d` and `E[T_between] = 2·Nₑ·d + (d-1)/(2·m)`, so
    `1 - E[T_within]/E[T_between] = 1/(1 + 4·Nₑ·m·d/(d-1))`, which is this body.

    **So the two forms are two STATISTICS, not two guesses at one number**, and
    the FALSIFIED verdict on the square recorded at `islandDemeCorrection` should
    be read that way: the measurement read `F_ST` as `1 - E[T_w]/E[T_b]` off the
    genealogies, which is exactly the quantity the linear form computes, so the
    square was on trial under a convention that is not its own. It is not
    evidence that Crow and Aoki are wrong about `G_ST`. What the corpus is
    entitled to say is that under ITS `F_ST` convention -- the Hudson
    ratio-of-averages one every `F_ST` here is written for -- the correction is
    linear. (At `d = 2` the two happen to coincide once the corpus's own
    two-population `Hudson = 2G/(1 + G)` bridge is applied: `G = 1/(1 + 4M)`
    maps to `1/(1 + 2M)`, which is the linear form there. That coincidence does
    NOT extend to `d > 2`, where the two-subpopulation bridge does not apply,
    and no `d > 2` conversion is claimed here.)

    Regime: `d` demes of equal size `Nₑ`, symmetric migration at rate `m`,
    mutation negligible relative to migration, and `F_ST` in the Hudson
    coalescence-time convention. This is the finite-`d`
    statement; `fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium` is its `d → ∞` limit.

    Empirical status: VALIDATED -- matches `validation/differential/refs.island_fst_finite_demes`,
    against which the differential check `islandModelFst-finite-demes` measures

/-! ### Relationship between Migration and Mutation Effects on Fst -/

/-- **Migration-mutation equivalence for Fst.**
    Under the island model, the equilibrium Fst has the same functional form
    whether the homogenizing force is migration or mutation:
    Fst_migration = 1/(1+4Nm), Fst_mutation = 1/(1+4Neμ).
    The key parameter is the scaled rate 4N × (rate). -/
theorem islandModelFst_eq_mutationForm (Ne m : ℝ) :
    fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium Ne m = fstMutationDriftEquilibrium (4 * Ne * m) := by
  unfold fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium fstMutationDriftEquilibrium
  ring

/-- **Combined migration and mutation reduce Fst below either alone.**
    When both migration (m) and mutation (μ) act, the equilibrium Fst
    is 1/(1 + 4Nm + 4Neμ), which is below either individual equilibrium.

    **The deme count is missing from the signature, and the quantity depends on
    it.** Measured against msprime's symmetric island model at equilibrium
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_verify.py`,
    `test_island_deme_count`), `Ne = 1000`, total emigration rate `m = 1e-3` so
    that `4*Ne*m = 4.0` is held FIXED, `mu = 1e-8`, Hudson `F_ST`, 24 replicates
    of 4 Mb, 40 diploids from each of two sampled demes:

      demes    this def    simulated F_ST
        2        0.2000    0.09314±0.01311     8.2 sems, +115 percent
        4        0.2000    0.16469±0.02700     1.3 sems
        8        0.2000    0.15502±0.01987     2.3 sems
       20        0.2000    0.14347±0.01971     2.9 sems

    The scaled rate `4*Ne*m` is identical in every row, so a formula in
    `(Ne, m, mu)` alone must return one number for all four; the measurement
    does not. The two-deme row is decisive on its own.

    Empirical status: **FALSIFIED at small deme count**, and UNTESTED as a
    many-deme limit -- the design above does not pin the deme-count factor
    itself, only that one is needed. A definition taking no deme count cannot
    state the regime it is the limit of; consumers at two or three demes are
    the ones this silently misinforms.

    Power: the prediction is constant at 0.2000 by construction across a design
    whose measurement spans 0.09314 to 0.16469, which is what makes the
    constancy refutable rather than merely unverified. 
    **The name was corrected, because the name was the falsity.** This body
    cannot express a deme-count factor -- its signature is `(Ne, m, mu)` and
    nothing else -- so no edit to the body can fix what the measurement above
    found. What could be fixed is the CLAIM: called
    `fstMigrationMutationEquilibrium`, it asserts it is the island-model
    equilibrium, which is false at small deme count; called
    `...ManyDemes`, it asserts it is the many-deme limit of one, and the limit
    it is the limit OF is now a definition in this file --
    `fstIslandEquilibriumFiniteDemes`, which carries `nDemes` explicitly and
    whose `islandDemeCorrection = d/(d - 1)` has since been measured and
    validated at `d = 2`.

    This is the whole content of the repair. A consumer at two or three demes
    now has to read a name that says the body does not apply to them, rather
    than a name that says it does. Documenting the restriction in prose while
    leaving the name unqualified is what let the two-deme error stand, and the
    same pattern was recorded on `asymmetricFst` in `PortabilityDrift`, whose
    name commits it to exactly two demes and which therefore could not be
    repaired this way at all. That one was repaired the other way instead: it
    now takes BOTH migration rates and returns the two-deme value at their sum,
    which is validated to 2.03 sems where the single-rate body it replaced was
    excluded at 79.9.

    Worst cell 2.3 sems against the limit form's 8.2 at two demes. The squared
    correction `(n/(n-1))^2` was also tried and is excluded: it gives 0.05882 at
    two demes, 5.7 sems low, where this form sits at 0.6.

    Power: at fixed `4 Ne m` the prediction spans 0.11111 to 0.19608 across the
    deme counts while the limit form is constant at 0.20000, so the design
    separates them by construction. -/

/-! ### Stepping-Stone Model Foundations -/

/-- **Characteristic length of one-dimensional isolation by distance.**
    `L = √(m·σ² / (2·μ))`, in units of the deme spacing. This is the Malécot /
    Kimura-Weiss decay scale: in an infinite linear array of demes with
    nearest-neighbour migration rate `m`, dispersal variance `σ²` and mutation
    rate `μ`, the probability that two genes sampled `d` demes apart are
    identical by descent falls off as `exp(-d/L)`.

    It is the balance point of two rates. At unit dispersal variance a lineage
    crosses a stretch of `L` demes in time `L²/m`, while mutation destroys
    identity in the two lineages at rate `2·μ`. Setting `L²/m = 1/(2·μ)` gives
    this body, and
    `steppingStoneCharacteristicLength_balances_mutation` states exactly that.

    **The mutation rate is mandatory and the deme size does not enter.** The
    form `√(2·Nₑ·m)` carries the deme size and no mutation rate. That is not a
    mis-set constant, it is the wrong function. `√(2·Nₑ·m)` is not even a
    length: `Nₑ` is a count of individuals, so the expression has units of
    √individuals, while `m/(2μ)` is a ratio of two per-generation rates and is
    dimensionless, as a squared deme count must be. The two forms disagree on
    both axes that matter. `√(2·Nₑ·m)` is constant in `μ` where the true scale
    goes as `μ^(-1/2)`, and grows as `√Nₑ` where the true scale does not depend
    on `Nₑ` at all. `validation/differential/heavy/h1_stepping_stone_length.py`
    measures those two exponents and is the standing check on this definition.

    **The dispersal variance is an explicit argument, and it is load-bearing.**
    `L` scales as `σ`, so a habitat with `σ² = 4` has a decay length twice that
    of one with `σ² = 1` -- a factor, not a rounding. A body that fixes `σ² = 1`
    has no argument with which to state the assumption, so every caller makes it
    and none writes it down.

    Regime: mutation-limited, i.e. distances comparable to `L`. Below `L`,
    isolation by distance is governed instead by the mutation-free coalescent
    result `DemographicHistory.demoSteppingStoneFst`, which is a different
    function and is derived separately.

    Measured on every axis that separates this body from `√(2·Nₑ·m)`:
    `d log L / d log μ = -0.502` against that form's `0`,
    `d log L / d log Nₑ = -0.000` against its `+1/2`, and
    `d log L / d log m = +0.510`. This body is confirmed and `√(2·Nₑ·m)` is
    excluded on two independent axes rather than one.

    Empirical status: MEASURED on all three axes above, and the body is the
    published Kimura-Weiss result. The dispersal-variance axis is MEASURED too:
    `d log L / d log σ² = +0.475` against `0` for a body without `σ²`, and the
    error from omitting `σ²` is `-26.9%` at `σ² = 2` and `-49.3%` at `σ² = 4`.

    Why an exponent is the decisive measurement here. A convention difference --
    infinite-alleles versus infinite-sites, say -- multiplies `μ` by a constant,
    which rescales every `L` UNIFORMLY AND CANNOT MOVE AN EXPONENT. A
    constant-factor discrepancy on this definition, of the +44% size seen here,
    therefore admits a convention artefact as its whole explanation and settles
    nothing. An exponent is immune to that entire class of explanation, which is
    why the `σ²` axis settles the question and is worth waiting for rather than
    estimating. The measured `+0.475` is the diffusion balance's `+1/2`.

    Signature consistency: both siblings carry a dispersal variance --
    `DemographicHistory.demoSteppingStoneFst (d Ne m σ_sq)` and
    `DemographicHistory.steppingStoneDiffusionTimescale (d σ_sq m)` -- so this
    signature matches the family. -/

/-! ### `continuousSteppingStoneFst` has been deleted

The corpus carried a second stepping-stone F_ST,
`continuousSteppingStoneFst L d = 1 - exp(-d/L)`, evaluated at
`L = steppingStoneCharacteristicLength`. It contradicted
`DemographicHistory.demoSteppingStoneFst d Nₑ m σ² = d/(d + 4·Nₑ·m·σ²)` by up
to 878% on the differential grid, so at most one of the two could be right.

The contradiction is decidable without simulation, and it is decided against
the exponential. `demoSteppingStoneFst` is derived from the coalescent in
`DemographicHistory`: the meeting time of two lineages `d` demes apart is
linear in `d`, `T(d) = d/(2σ²m)`, and `F_ST = T/(T + 2Nₑ)` then gives the
hyperbolic `d/(d + 4Nₑσ²m)` exactly, with
`steppingStoneFst_from_coalescence_time` proving that equality. A linear
meeting time under the `T/(T+2Nₑ)` map cannot produce `1 - exp(-d/L)` for any
`L`: the two agree only to first order in `d`, and there they agree only if
`L = 4·Nₑ·m·σ²`, which is not the scale the corpus passed and is not a
mutation scale at all. The exponential had no derivation anywhere in the
corpus and no theorem tying it to anything.

Its three theorems -- `continuousSteppingStoneFst_nonneg`, `_increases` and
`_decreases_with_L` -- are absent with it, and their absence carries the
lesson. All three are monotonicity and sign facts, true of the exponential body
as written, and `d/(d + 4Nₑmσ²)` satisfies them equally. Facts of that shape
cannot detect a wrong functional form. Callers wanting a stepping-stone F_ST
should use `demoSteppingStoneFst`. -/

/-! ### Allele Frequency Homogenization by Migration -/

/-- **Allele frequency convergence under migration.**
    Starting from initial frequency p₀ in a deme, the frequency after t
    generations of migration at rate m toward a continent with frequency p_c is:
    p(t) = p_c + (p₀ - p_c) × (1-m)^t.
    The deviation from the continental frequency decays geometrically.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk16.py`). Wright-Fisher with
    migration toward a fixed continent, `N = 40000` so drift stays far below the
    deterministic signal, 400 replicates, four times per parameter set:

      m        p0     p_c    worst of t in {5,15,30,60}     rel err
      0.010    0.8    0.2     1.95 sems                     0.03%
      0.050    0.9    0.3     under 2 sems                  under 0.03%
      0.002    0.1    0.6     under 2 sems                  under 0.03%

    Twelve cells at 0.03% relative, with the sign of `p0 - p_c` reversed in the
    third set so the approach is tested from both directions.

    Read a second way, `log |p_t - p_c|` is linear in `t` with slope
    `log (1 - m)`; the fitted slopes come out 0.21% steep, at 10.14 sems. That
    residual is an artifact of the readout and not of this body. `log` of a
    noisy quantity is biased downward by Jensen, and the bias grows as
    `|p_t - p_c|` shrinks toward the replicate noise, which steepens a fitted
    slope; the effect is largest in the `m = 0.05` set whose tail decays
    furthest. The trajectory reading, which involves no logarithm, agrees at
    0.03% across all twelve cells, and it is the one that carries the status.
    Both are reported because a 10-sem disagreement that is understood is worth
    more on the record than one that is dropped. -/

/-! ### Migration and LD Homogenization -/

/-- **LD similarity between populations under migration.**
    Populations exchanging migrants share more similar LD patterns.
    We model the LD correlation as a function of scaled migration rate:
    LD_correlation(M) = M² / (1 + M)² (proportion of LD that is shared).
    This accounts for both allele frequency sharing and haplotype sharing.

    **This is a stipulation, not a derivation, and the name says so.** No source is
    cited, nothing derives this shape from a migration process, and no theorem here
    constrains it beyond monotonicity and range. Do not rename it to assert a derivation
    unless one is supplied.

    Empirical status: **FALSIFIED** (`simcov/battery_bulk51.py`, `group_a`).
    The comparison the paragraph above says nobody had made has now been made,
    and the ansatz does not survive it.

    Two-deme island model at `Nₑ = 1000` over 5 Mb with recombination; the
    observable is the cross-deme correlation of signed LD `r` across SNP pairs
    common in BOTH demes -- the quantity this body names -- with `4·Nₑ·m` swept a
    hundredfold:

      4Nₑm    measured LD correlation   this ansatz   M/(1+M)
      0.4     0.8908 ± 0.0196           0.0816        0.2857

      40      0.9898 ± 0.0004           0.9518        0.9756

    Worst cell 87 sems at 53% relative. The failure is worst at LOW migration,
    where the ansatz predicts almost no shared LD and the simulation finds
    nearly complete sharing. The unsquared `M/(1+M)` is carried alongside and is
    also FALSIFIED, at 48 sems -- so this is not a matter of one power too many.
    Both forms decay with migration; the measured correlation does not.

    Why: LD structure between two demes is set largely by the recombination
    history they SHARED before separating, and that persists long after
    migration has stopped homogenising allele frequencies. Neither form has a
    term for it. `PortabilityDrift.sharedLD_from_equilibrium` records the same
    finding from the other direction.

    Control: one panmictic population split into two arbitrary halves, through
    the same estimators and filters, gives `F_ST` indistinguishable from zero

## Derivation of Fst from Wright-Fisher Drift Dynamics

Rather than *defining* Fst as a formula, we *derive* it from the fundamental
Wright-Fisher recurrence for heterozygosity.  The key identity is:

  H(t+1) = (1 - 1/(2N)) × H(t)

which expresses the fact that two alleles drawn from generation t+1 are
identical by descent with probability 1/(2N), leaving heterozygosity reduced
by that factor each generation.

We then:
1. Solve this recurrence in closed form by induction.
2. Define Fst(t) = 1 - H(t)/H₀ and derive its properties.
3. Introduce mutation, find the equilibrium heterozygosity H* = θ/(1+θ),
   and derive Fst_eq = 1/(1+θ) as a *consequence*.

/-! ### Pure-drift heterozygosity recurrence -/

/-- **Heterozygosity recurrence under pure drift.**
    Each generation, the probability that two sampled alleles are distinct
    is reduced by a factor of (1 - 1/(2Ne)).

    Regime: closed population, no mutation. This is the root of the cluster that
    `Calibrator.DriftRegime` dissects: every quantity downstream of this
    recurrence is a function of the single number `(1 - 1/(2Ne))^t`, so every
    cross-check among them holds at every value of it, correct or not
    (`crossChecks_blind_to_retention`). At mutation-drift balance the measured
    retention is `1.02 ± 0.02` against `e^(-2) = 0.135` predicted here, and the
    resulting `F_ST` is `≈ 0` where the measurable between-population `F_ST` is
    `0.50`. The recurrence is correct for what it says; it is not a split `F_ST`. -/

/-! ### Fst derived from heterozygosity loss -/

/-- **Within-population heterozygosity loss, derived from the decay recurrence.**
    `L(t) = 1 - H(t)/H₀ = 1 - (1 - 1/(2Ne))^t`.

    **This is not a split `F_ST`.** For between-population `F_ST` after a split use
    `coalFst t Ne = t / (t + 2 Nₑ)`.

    Regime: closed population, no mutation. **Being derived is not a defence, and this
    is derived only WITHIN that regime**: the recurrence it comes from lets heterozygosity
    decay with nothing replenishing it. Under mutation-drift balance
    heterozygosity is stationary, the retention is measured at `1.025 ± 0.020`
    at `Ne = 1000`, `t = 4000` where this expression's factor gives `0.135`,
    and the between-population `F_ST` at that design point is `0.50` while this
    formula's cluster reports approximately zero. `Calibrator.DriftRegime`
    exhibits both regimes and proves they disagree at every positive time.

    Being derived rather than stipulated is what made this look safe. It is not
    a defence: a derivation inherits every premise of the process it derives
    from, and this one inherits the closed population.

    Empirical status: FALSIFIED at demographic equilibrium; see
    `closedPopulation`. Inside the declared regime it stands.

    Denotes: the reading its name carries. The same formula appears under
    names from 'fst', 'heterozygosity', and the formula alone does not fix which is meant. -/

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**

    Wright-Fisher, 220 replicate populations started MONOMORPHIC so the whole

    The ORACLE is the finding here. An earlier run of this same design against a
    BIALLELIC Wright-Fisher missed by 632 sems, and the arithmetic says why:
    under biallelic two-way mutation `p - 1/2` contracts by `1 - 2 mu` and
    `H = 1/2 - 2 (p - 1/2)^2`, so the exact input term there is `2 mu (1 - 2 H)`,
    not the `2 mu (1 - H)` this body carries. The two differ by `2 mu H`, which
    is O(mu) per step. This body's term is the INFINITE-ALLELES one, which is
    what the docstring above declares -- a new mutation is always a novel allele,
    so a homozygote becomes heterozygous with probability `2 mu` -- and on the
    matching oracle it is correct.

    Both candidates were carried through so the data chose rather than the
    argument: the biallelic term reaches 2.84 sems and 11.2% relative on the same
    trajectories where this body reaches 1.01 sems and 6.5%. That is a
    preference, not an exclusion, and it is stated as one.

    The reason this needed iterating to see: an O(mu) error per step hides under

## Derivation of Transient Fst from Heterozygosity Recurrence with Mutation

The discrete-time analogue of `fstMutationDriftTransient` is DERIVED here, not assumed,
from the heterozygosity recurrence that includes both drift and mutation, using only:
1. The recurrence H(t+1) = λ H(t) + c, where λ = (1 - 1/(2N))(1 - θ/(2N))
   and c captures mutation input.
2. The closed-form solution of affine recurrences via geometric series.
3. The equilibrium H* = θ/(1+θ) (already derived above as a fixed point).
4. The definition Fst(t) = 1 - H(t)/H₀.

The key insight: when we approximate (1-μ)² ≈ 1 - 2μ and set θ = 4Nμ,
the per-generation decay factor for heterozygosity becomes
  λ = (1 - 1/(2N)) × (1 - θ/(2N))
and mutation-drift balance yields the transient formula
  Fst(t) = [1/(1+θ)] × (1 - λ^t).

/-! ### Heterozygosity recurrence with mutation -/

/-- **Per-generation decay factor under mutation and drift.**
    λ = (1 - 1/(2N)) × (1 - θ/(2N)).
    The first factor is drift (coalescence probability 1/(2N)),
    the second captures the approximate mutation effect:
    two lineages both fail to mutate with probability (1-μ)² ≈ 1 - 2μ = 1 - θ/(2N).

    **This is `Calibrator.hetDecayFromScaled` applied, not a second copy of its body.
    Do not inline the product `(1 - 1/(2Ne)) * (1 - θ/(2Ne))` here.** Every call site
    unfolds the PAIR `hetDecayFactor hetDecayFromScaled` — including
    `Calibrator.Conventions` and `Calibrator.DemographicHistory` — and an inlined body
    leaves no `hetDecayFromScaled` in the goal for the second unfold to find. The
    two-name unfold is the contract: inlining breaks five proofs in three files.

    Empirical status: UNTESTED. -/
noncomputable def hetDecayFactor (Ne θ : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  hetDecayFromScaled Ne θ

/-- **Heterozygosity recurrence with mutation (affine recurrence).**
    H(t+1) = λ H(t) + c, where λ = hetDecayFactor and
    c = (1 - λ) H* (since H* is the fixed point, c = (1-λ) H*).
    Rather than tracking c explicitly we parametrise by the equilibrium H*
    and λ, since the affine recurrence H(t+1) = λ H(t) + c has
    fixed point H* = c/(1-λ), i.e. c = (1-λ) H*.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk15.py`). Measured against the
    same infinite-alleles trajectories as `hetMutationDriftRecurrence`, with
    `lam = 1 - 1/(2 Ne) - 2 mu` and `Hstar = theta/(1 + theta)`, iterated fifteen
    generations from a measured start: worst cell 1.01 sems, 6.5% relative,
    across `theta` of 0.80 and 1.00 and `Ne` of 50, 100 and 200.

    Deliberately NOT compared against the sibling recurrence. The two are the
    same map in different coordinates -- expanding
    `(1 - 1/(2Ne)) H + 2 mu (1 - H)` gives slope `1 - 1/(2Ne) - 2 mu` and
    intercept `2 mu`, and `2 mu / (1/(2Ne) + 2 mu) = theta/(1 + theta)` -- so
    agreement between them is an algebraic identity carrying no empirical weight.
    The battery reports that identity separately and labels it a SELF-TEST. What
    is measured here is the trajectory.

    The engine runs about 1% hot against the known plateau (`H = 0.4489` and
    `0.5044` measured against `theta/(1+theta) = 0.4444` and `0.5000`), which is
    the same systematic `ia_engine.selftest` reports, so it is disclosed rather
    than absorbed: it is a tenth of the gap being resolved here. -/

/-! ### Fst from heterozygosity ratio -/

/-- **Transient Fst from heterozygosity ratio.**
    Fst(t) = 1 - H(t)/H₀.

    Regime: closed Wright-Fisher drift, no mutation, no migration, no
    selection. With a mutation floor the ratio does not run to one; see
    `PortabilityDrift.hetMutationFloor`.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED** (`simcov/battery_bulk21.py`, `group_ab`).
    Two isolated Wright-Fisher demes started at a common frequency, 20000
    replicate pairs, with `H` measured directly as the mean `2p(1-p)` and
    compared against the classical decay `H_t/H₀ = (1 - 1/(2Nₑ))ᵗ` -- a
    prediction derived independently of this body, so what is on trial is
    whether the heterozygosity ratio is the drift `F` and not merely whether
    two transcriptions of one formula agree. Over `Nₑ` = 50, 100, 200 and `t` =
    40, 60, 120, 200 the measured ratio gives 0.18125, 0.18109, 0.25736,
    0.45429 and 0.63124 against the classical 0.18168, 0.18168, 0.25946,
    0.45284 and 0.63304, worst cell 0.98 sems at 0.28% relative, over a
    prediction spanning 71%. `Nₑ` and `t` are moved separately, so the two
    cells that reach `F ≈ 0.18` by different routes both have to hold.

    Caution, recorded because this battery walked into it: `driftVariance` and
    `expectedFreqDiffSq` compared against the SAME simulated trajectories are
    NOT independent measurements of anything. Given only the martingale
    property `E[p_t] = p₀`, `p₀(1-p₀)(1 - H_t/H₀)` reduces identically to
    `Var(p_t)`, so those comparisons return the drift model's own algebra and
    scored MATCH at 0.00 sems in three cells. The heterozygosity decay above is
    the only one of the four that a simulation can refute. -/

marks the point. Consumers must require `H₀ ≠ 0`. -/

/-- **The proportional-reduction form, written three times in this corpus, related here so
that a change to any one of them fails to compile.**

`fstFromHetRatio H H₀`, `hudsonFstFromCoalescenceTimes ETss ETst` and `DGP.r2FromMSE mse
varY` are all `1 - residual/baseline`.  They are **not one quantity**: the first divides a
heterozygosity by an ancestral heterozygosity, the second an expected within-population
coalescence time by a between-population one, the third a mean squared error by a total
outcome variance.  Nothing lets a value of one be substituted for another.

What they share is the *measure*, and sharing it is not a coincidence — proportional
reduction of a residual against a baseline is one construction, and each of the three is
an instance of it.  That is why this is stated rather than left to the reader: the three
definitions carry no shared symbol, so before this theorem an edit to any one of them
diverged from the other two silently.

A fourth instance, `PCCorrectability.Diagnostic.pcTargetAxisEfficacy`, is deliberately
absent.  `Diagnostic` imports nothing from this corpus outside `PCCorrectability`, and no
module imports both it and any of the three below, so **no file can currently state that
identity at all.** Closing that one needs an import, not a theorem. -/

/-- **Discrete transient Fst under mutation and drift.**
    Fst(t) = [1/(1+θ)] × (1 - λ^t) where λ = (1-1/(2N))(1-θ/(2N)).
    This is the closed-form discrete-time formula. The continuous version
    `fstMutationDriftTransient` (using exp) is the large-Ne approximation.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk16.py`), on the same
    infinite-alleles trajectories as `fstMutationDriftTransient` and to the same
    precision: worst cell 2.27 sems, 6.5% relative, across `Ne` of 50, 100 and
    200 and five times per set spanning `t/Ne` from 0.25 to 4.

    The two forms were carried together deliberately, since this one replaces
    `exp(-(1+theta) t/(2 Ne))` by `hetDecayFactor^t` and the substitution is
    exact only to O(1/Ne). The design reached down to `Ne = 50`, where the two
    predictions differ by about a percent, and the measurement's own noise is
    six percent. They therefore did NOT separate, and neither is credited with
    beating the other. What is established is the common content: the plateau
    and the rate at which it is approached.

    Separating them needs about a hundredfold increase in replicates at small
    `Ne`, which is worth doing only if something downstream depends on the
    difference; nothing currently does. -/

    (normalized ancestral heterozygosity):

    Step 1: Closed form gives H(t) = H* + (1 - H*) λ^t.
    Step 2: Fst(t) = 1 - H(t)/1 = 1 - H* - (1-H*) λ^t = (1-H*)(1 - λ^t).
    Step 3: 1 - H* = 1/(1+θ) = Fst_eq.
