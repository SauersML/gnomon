## Global vs Local Ancestry

Admixed individuals have heterogeneous ancestry along the genome.
A PGS trained on a single ancestry group performs differently
depending on the local ancestry at each PGS locus.
-/

section GlobalVsLocalAncestry

/- **Global ancestry proportion.**
    For a two-way admixed individual: proportion α from pop A,
    (1-α) from pop B. The expected PGS performance depends on α. -/

/-- **The cross term is bounded by the geometric mean.**
    R²_cross ≤ √(R²_A × R²_B) by Cauchy-Schwarz.
    We prove: √(R²_A × R²_B) ≤ max(R²_A, R²_B), i.e., the geometric
    mean never exceeds the larger of the two R² values. -/

## Local Ancestry-Informed PGS

Using local ancestry to weight PGS contributions from each
genomic segment by the appropriate ancestry-specific model.
-/

section LocalAncestryPGS

/- **Local ancestry-informed PGS.**
    PGS_LAI = Σᵢ [L_i = A] × β_A_i × g_i + [L_i = B] × β_B_i × g_i
    where L_i is local ancestry and β_A, β_B are ancestry-specific effects. -/

/-- **LAI-PGS is at least as good as single-ancestry PGS.**
    By using the correct ancestry-specific effects at each locus,
    LAI-PGS reduces bias. Model: standard PGS uses a single β across
    all segments, while LAI uses β_A or β_B depending on local ancestry.
    For admixture proportion α, the LAI variance captured is
    α × β_A² × H_A + (1-α) × β_B² × H_B, while standard captures
    (α × β_A + (1-α) × β_B)² × H_avg ≤ the LAI amount (by convexity). -/

  · simp [min_eq_right (le_of_lt hab)]; nlinarith

/-- **LAI accuracy required for improvement.**
    LAI-PGS only helps if local ancestry can be called accurately.
    With error rate ε in LAI, the improvement is proportional to (1-2ε). -/

/-- **LAI accuracy decreases with admixture time.**
    Older admixture → shorter ancestry tracts → harder to call.
    For admixture t generations ago, mean tract length = 1/(t×r). -/

/-- **LAI-PGS improvement is largest for recently admixed individuals.**
    With long ancestry tracts, LAI is more accurate and the
    ancestry-specific effects can be applied more precisely.
    The LAI gain scales with (1 - 2ε) where ε is the LAI error rate.
    Recent admixture has lower ε (longer tracts → easier to call). -/

## Admixture Mapping and Portability

Admixture mapping leverages local ancestry to detect loci where
one ancestry's alleles contribute more to the phenotype.
-/

section AdmixtureMapping

/- **Admixture mapping signal.**
    At a causal locus, the phenotype correlates with local ancestry
    if the causal allele has different frequency across ancestries. -/

/-- **Admixture mapping is complementary to GWAS.**
    GWAS finds SNP-trait associations; admixture mapping finds
    loci where ancestry matters. The intersection identifies
    loci contributing to portability loss. -/

/-- **Admixture mapping power depends on Fst at the locus.**
    Power ∝ n × Fst_locus × β². High Fst loci are easier to detect
    and also the ones most responsible for portability loss. -/

/-- **Admixture-informed portability correction.**
    At loci where admixture mapping detects a signal, we can
    use ancestry-specific effects to correct the PGS.
    The correction size is proportional to Δβ × Fst_locus. -/

## Tractor: Ancestry-Specific GWAS in Admixed Samples

The Tractor method performs ancestry-specific GWAS within admixed
samples, enabling estimation of population-specific effects.
-/

section Tractor

/- **Tractor decomposes admixed genotypes by local ancestry.**
    At each locus, the allele count is split into ancestry-specific
    components: g = g_A + g_B where g_A counts alleles from ancestry A. -/

/- **Ancestry-specific effect estimation.**
    Tractor regresses: Y ~ g_A × β_A + g_B × β_B + covariates.
    This directly estimates the ancestry-specific effects needed
    for portable PGS construction. -/

/-- **Tractor requires large admixed sample size.**
    Effective per-ancestry N ≈ α × N_admixed for ancestry proportion α.
    Both ancestry components need adequate N for stable estimation. -/
theorem tractor_effective_n

  exact ⟨mul_pos h_α h_n, mul_pos (by linarith) h_n⟩

/-- **Ancestry-specific effects test for portability.**
    If β_A = β_B at a locus, the locus is "portable" across ancestries.
    If β_A ≠ β_B, the locus contributes to portability loss. -/

/-- **Multi-ancestry meta-analysis combines Tractor with standard GWAS.**
    Using Tractor effects from admixed samples + standard GWAS from
    homogeneous samples gives the most portable PGS. -/

## Ancestry Continuous Representation

Moving beyond discrete ancestry groups to continuous
ancestry representation using principal components.
-/

section ContinuousAncestry

/- **PC-based continuous ancestry.**
    Ancestry is represented as a point in PC space rather than
    a discrete label. This better captures the continuous nature
    of human genetic variation. -/

/-- **PGS accuracy as a function of PC distance.**
    R²(d) where d is the PC distance from the training centroid.

/-- **Within-group variation dominates between-group variation.**
    When the variance explained by between-group signal is small relative to the
    within-group variance scale `cv²`, the between-group signal is overwhelmed.
    If the between-group variance is strictly below `var_total / cv²`, then the
    resulting between-group `R² = var_between / var_total` is strictly below
    `1 / cv²`.

    Worked example: Wang et al. find R² ≈ 0.5% for distance-on-error,
    far below the χ²₁ cv² = 2. -/

    _ = 1 * var_total := (one_mul var_total).symm

/-- **Optimal ancestry granularity for PGS application.**
    Too coarse (continental groups) loses information.
    Too fine (exact PC coordinates) adds noise with small samples.
    Optimal depends on available calibration data. -/

/-- **Portability gap creates health disparities.**
    Groups with worse portability get less clinical benefit from PGS.
    The gap scales with Fst from the discovery population.
    Portability ≈ 1 - c × Fst for some constant c > 0, so higher Fst
    means lower portability (larger gap = 1 - portability). -/

/-- **Equitable PGS requires proportional investment.**
    To achieve equal R² across populations, the sample size
    for underrepresented groups must be larger than proportional
    to their population size (due to the LD mismatch penalty).
    If the LD penalty factor is k > 1, then n_needed = k × n_proportional. -/

/-- **Universal portability is impossible.**
    No single PGS can achieve equal R² in all populations,
    because genetic architecture genuinely differs (GxE, selection).
    With k ≥ 2 populations at different Fst values and portability
    decaying as (1 - c × Fst), the max and min R² must differ
    when Fst values differ. -/
