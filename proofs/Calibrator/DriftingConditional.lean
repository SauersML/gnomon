# A drifting response curve: what a moving threshold hides, and what the dynamics give back

Imports Mathlib and `Calibrator.Probability`, for the standard normal `Phi`.

A response curve is `c_t(s) = P(Y = 1 | S = s)` at time `t` — disease risk as a function of a
polygenic score, ancestry coordinate, or any covariate, in a population that is itself moving.
Three questions decide whether anything read off such a curve means anything: what is invisible
in principle, what survives the drift, and how much an interior estimate can be trusted.

## The threshold gauge, and why statics cannot break it

In a liability-threshold model `Y = 1[Z > θ]` — the standard reading of a polygenic score, with
`Z` liability and `θ` a diagnostic threshold — apply any strictly increasing `h` to the liability
axis. `indicator_lt_eq_of_strictMono` records that the indicator is unchanged. Every observable is
unchanged; the threshold path is changed into an arbitrary increasing relabelling, and can be
flattened to zero. **From response curves alone the threshold path is identifiable at most up to
monotone relabelling**, so a study reporting that diagnostic thresholds moved, on the strength of
fitted curves at several times, is reporting a gauge choice.

Fixing the noise shape narrows it to exactly one direction rather than all of them.
`linkedCurve_identified_modulo_constants` shows the observable determines `m_t - θ_t` and nothing
finer: the unidentified set is the constants-in-`s`, and it is exactly the constants. A
population shift that is uniform across the covariate and a threshold move of the same size are
the same observation, forever, at any density of sampling.

## The dynamics break it, because a generator kills constants

`sum_invariantWeight_mul_generator_eq_zero` is the mechanism: averaging against an invariant
distribution annihilates the population's own dynamics. So if the linked curve moves by a Markov
generator plus a spatially constant threshold velocity, the invariant average of its motion sees
only the threshold:

`invariantAverage_eq_neg_of_affine_evolution`: `Σ ϖ ∂ₜu = -θ̇`.

Everything on the right is observable. This is the whole content: **statics can never separate a
moving threshold from a moving population, and dynamics always can — provided the population
model carries no constant forcing.** `constantForcing_conflates_threshold` is the sharpness: add a
spatially uniform forcing `ζ` and the same average returns `ζ - θ̇`, so only the difference is
ever identified. A Markov generator is exactly a model whose forcing cone excludes constants,
which is why drift rescues an identification no amount of static data can reach.

For genetics the reading is direct. Secular change in diagnostic criteria, in ascertainment, or
in the definition of a case is a moving `θ`; environmental and demographic change is a moving
`m`. Cross-cohort recalibration studies routinely attribute drift in polygenic score performance
to one or the other. The separation is available, but only from the *motion*, and only if the
population's own dynamics are modelled as conservative — which is what a generator is.

## What survives a genuinely mixing drift

`continuousInvariant_eq_at_limit`: a continuous functional constant along the flow takes the same
value on the initial curve and on its limit. Under ergodic mixing the limit is the constant curve
at the base rate, so every continuous invariant of the response curve is a function of prevalence
alone. Discrimination, calibration slope, threshold location, curve shape: all transient. **Under
mixing the base rate is the only stable summary**, and the corpus's separate observation that
prevalence is the conserved charge of the drift is the same fact from the other side.

## How much an interior estimate can be trusted

`interiorError_sq_le_mul_endpoints` is the interpolation bound at the midpoint, in squared form so
that nothing is taken square roots of: the error energy at the midpoint is at most the product of
the endpoint energies. The constant is exactly one, and `singleMode_interiorError_eq` shows a
single spectral mode attains it, so the constant cannot be improved. An estimate of the response
curve between two observation times inherits the geometric mean of the errors at those times;
error does not blow up in the interior, and the hardest data are pure single modes.

## Scope

The finite-state and finite-mixture results are proved as stated. The Gaussian averaging identity,
affine-probit invariance, and the algebraic core of the drift-diffusion evolution law are also
proved. The full affine-probit necessity classification, `link_rigidity`, is proved: not through
the link's density, which would need smoothness the hypotheses do not give, but by reading the
link as the cdf of a liability measure and classifying the measures that are affinely
self-similar under Gaussian blurring. The reconstruction operator built from the observed
marginal likewise needs diffusion generators, Fréchet curve spaces, and time reversal.
`stationaryDrift_collapses_to_generator` proves the stationary algebraic core: the curve's
transport drift collapses back to the generator's own drift, which is why the stationary flow is
the semigroup itself.

Empirical status: DERIVED. The identification and stability results are proved at the stated
hypotheses; whether a given cohort series satisfies them — a conservative population model, a
known link, an invariant distribution — is an empirical question this asks to be answered rather
than assumed.
-/

/-! ## Two-point rigidity inside the probit family

The elementary rigidity below makes the later classification worth wanting: a probit response
curve is pinned by its values at two distinct covariate points, so the two-parameter
probit family admits no deformation at all once two observations are fixed.

The consequence for a drifting cohort is the one the scope note gestures at. If a
response curve is probit at each time and the drift moves it continuously, then the
whole trajectory is carried by two numbers, and any two time points that agree in the
curve at two covariate values agree in the curve everywhere. Rigidity is what makes
"the curve drifted" a two-parameter statement rather than an infinite-dimensional one.

Gaussian preservation is proved later by an explicit product-measure argument. Necessity — that
closure under every Gaussian averaging step forces affine-probit shape — is the classification
theorem `link_rigidity`, and it is proved too.

this is exactly the statement that slope is identified and intercept is identified only

/-! ## Reconstruction: transporting a conditional through the observed marginal

Theorem 14. The marked subpopulation `q` and the population `p` are pushed forward by the SAME
one-step coupling, so a conditional observed at one time can be transported to the next by
pushing forward `κ p` and dividing by the pushed-forward marginal. That ratio is Bayes' rule
built from the observed marginals, and it is exact rather than approximate: nothing is estimated
in `reconstruct_eq_of_pushed_marked`, the two sides are the same number.

`reconstruct_between` is the half that makes it usable. The operator is a weighted average of the
conditional's own values, so it cannot leave their range: an error in the observed conditional is
never amplified by transporting it forward. That is the forward direction of the asymmetry the
analysis turns on, and the backward direction — where the same structure inverts and amplifies —
The backward direction is `pushForward_not_injective`, and it is worse than
amplification: under complete mixing the operator collapses distinct conditionals onto the same
image, so inverting it is not an ill-conditioned problem but an underdetermined one. No amount of
data about the pushed-forward conditional recovers which conditional produced it. -/

/-- **The backward direction is not merely amplifying, it is undetermined.**

`reconstruct_between` says transporting a conditional forward cannot leave the range of its own
values, so forward error never grows. The reverse fails for a stronger reason than instability:
a completely mixing step sends two different conditionals to the SAME image, so there is no
backward map to be ill-conditioned. Recovering the earlier conditional from the later one is not
a hard inverse problem; it is not an inverse problem.

The witness is the uniform two-state coupling with the two point conditionals. -/

/-! ## Probit invariance under Ornstein-Uhlenbeck drift

Theorem 3. Averaging the probit link against a Gaussian returns a probit link with a rescaled
slope, so the two-parameter family `Φ(a x + b)` is exactly invariant under the OU semigroup. That
is why the realization is two-dimensional and curved rather than linear, which is the escape from
the spectral obstruction: no bounded link has a finite-dimensional invariant SUBSPACE, and this
one has an invariant MANIFOLD.

The whole content sits in one Gaussian identity, `gaussianAverage_probit`, and that identity is
proved below. The proof is the standard coupling — `E[Φ(α + βZ)]` is
`P(W ≤ α + βZ)` for an independent standard normal `W`, and `W - βZ` is centred Gaussian with
variance `1 + β²`.  The formal argument supplies both pieces: Mathlib's Gaussian convolution and
the conditioning step that turns the expectation of a cdf into a probability of a linear
combination.

`probit_invariant_under_ou` is then derived rather than assumed: from the identity, the
invariance and the exact new slope follow by algebra, which is proved. So the module carries one
proved analytic spine instead of an untracked paragraph of prose, and everything the analysis
draws from Theorem 3 downstream is connected to it. -/

    Averaging the standard cdf over a Gaussian shift is the law of a difference: `E[Φ(α + βZ)]`
    is `P(W ≤ α + βZ)` for an independent standard normal `W`, which is `P(W - βZ ≤ α)`, and
    `W - βZ` is centred Gaussian with variance `1 + β²`.

    `Measure.prod_apply` slices the product measure into exactly this average, and

    the difference. The proof includes the passage from the lower integral of measures to the

/-! ## Rigidity of the probit shape

Theorem 4. Theorem 3 says the probit family is invariant. The correct rigidity target is an
**affine-probit** link `p + q * Φ (αu + β)`, not a bare probit: Gaussian averaging acts on the
argument and therefore cannot identify a vertical offset `p` or scale `q`. The earlier bare-probit
target was false; for example `1 / 4 + (1 / 2) * Φ u` is strictly increasing, takes values in
`(0,1)`, and has the same closure property.

This correction matters biologically. A nonzero floor and a ceiling below one represent persistent
case-label contamination, incomplete ascertainment, or penetrance bounded away from one. Population
drift can determine the Gaussian latent-response *shape*, but it cannot manufacture the two
external anchors needed to identify those observation-channel limits. A bare probit follows only
after the scientifically separate tail calibration `p = 0`, `p + q = 1`.

Both directions are proved. Sufficiency is `probit_link_invariant`, Theorem 3 rearranged: the
averaged probit is a probit, and the new parameters are exhibited. Necessity is `link_rigidity`.

Necessity does not go through the density. Differentiating the invariance would need smoothness
the hypotheses do not give, so the route here is measure-theoretic: a bounded increasing link is
the cdf of a finite liability measure, Gaussian averaging of the link is Gaussian blurring of that
measure, and the invariance says the measure is affinely self-similar under blurring at every
scale. Iterating the resulting characteristic-function equation evaluates it in closed form, and
it is Gaussian. The vertical offset and scale survive that argument and remain in the
conclusion. -/

A monotone function has countably many discontinuities, the affine map
`z ↦ a (x + σ z) + b` is injective when `a σ ≠ 0`, and the standard Gaussian has no
atoms.  So the pullback of the discontinuity set is countable and therefore null.

This is what makes dominated convergence available below.  Without it the pointwise
limit hypothesis fails: `y ↦ L (a (y + σ z) + b)` is continuous at `x` only where `L` is
continuous, and a monotone `L` is not assumed continuous anywhere. -/

/-- **The averaged link is continuous, even though the link is not assumed to be.**

Dominated convergence along the neighbourhood filter: the integrand is bounded by `1`,
the measure is a probability measure, and by `link_discontinuity_null` the pointwise limit
holds for almost every noise value.

This is the first regularity gained from the invariance rather than assumed, and it is
the step the classification needs before anything can be differentiated. Biologically,
cohort mixing smooths even a response curve with threshold jumps: discontinuities in
individual liability occupy zero mass after a continuously distributed environmental or
ancestry shift. -/

/-- **The averaging operator is `L` integrated against a Gaussian whose mean is the
covariate.**

This is the change of variables the classification needs.  On the left the covariate `x`
sits inside `L`, where nothing is known about it beyond monotonicity; on the right it sits
only in the mean of the measure, which is as smooth in `x` as anything could be.  Every
route to regularity for `L` goes through moving `x` out of `L` and into the kernel, and
this is that move.

What still has to be supplied afterwards is the differentiation under the integral sign:
`gaussianReal` is `volume.withDensity (gaussianPDF …)`, so the right-hand side is an
integral of `L` against a density smooth in `x`, and `L` is bounded — the ingredients of a
dominated-convergence argument.  That argument is not made here. -/

/-- **Two averaging scales compose into one.**

`(z₁, z₂) ↦ x + s z₁ + t z₂` pushes the product of two standard Gaussians to
`N(x, s² + t²)`: it is a sum of two independent Gaussian coordinates, and variances add.

This is the semigroup law of the averaging operator, and it is what turns the
classification from an analytic problem into an algebraic one.  Averaging at scale `s` and
then at scale `t` is averaging once at scale `√(s² + t²)`, so the induced parameter map of
`link_rigidity` — well defined by `link_invariance_params_unique` — must satisfy a
composition identity in the scale.  For the probit that identity is
`α(√(s²+t²)) = α(s) · α(α(s) t)` with `α(s) = 1/√(1+s²)`, and pinning `α` is what pins the

Fubini turns the product integral of `link_average_two_scale` into an average at scale `t`
of an average at scale `s`.  This is the shape the classification uses: applying the
invariance to the inner average and then to the outer one produces the induced parameters
of the two steps composed, while the right-hand side produces the induced parameters at the
single combined scale.  Uniqueness (`link_invariance_params_unique`) then equates them, and
what is left is an equation in one real variable.

For the probit the resulting law is `α(√(s²+t²)) = α(s) · α(α(s) t)` with
`α(s) = 1/√(1+s²)`, which one verifies directly:
`α(s) · α(α(s) t) = (1/√(1+s²)) · √(1+s²)/√(1+s²+t²)`.  Pinning `α` pins the link. -/

If averaging at scale `t` returns `L` reparametrised by `(αt, βt)`, then averaging at scale

`(average at scale αt·s)(αt·x + βt) = (average at scale √(s²+t²))(x)`.

This is the classification's governing equation, and it is now a statement about one real
parameter.  For the probit, `αt = 1/√(1+t²)` and `βt = 0`, and the law reads
`α(αt·s) · αt = α(√(s²+t²))`, which is `1/√(1+s²+t²)` on both sides.

Averaging at scale `t` and then at scale `s` gives the same affine parameters as averaging
at scale `s` and then at scale `t` — because both routes are averaging once at
`√(s² + t²)`, and that is symmetric in `s` and `t`.

Written out, the slope equation is `α(α(t)·s)·α(t) = α(α(s)·t)·α(s)`.  This is the
constraint that pins the scale family: it is not satisfied by a generic decreasing
`α : (0,∞) → (0,1]`, and `α(s) = 1/√(1 + c²s²)` satisfies it because both sides collapse to
`1/√(1 + c²(s² + t²))`.

Unlike `link_scale_params_compose` this needs no representation of the combined scale — the
two-step routes are compared directly — so it constrains the parameter map using only the

The classification below says its boundedness hypothesis is load-bearing because it rules
out the affine and half-line-exponential links. For the affine stratum that is provable
outright, and is proved here: a strictly increasing affine map is unbounded above, so it
cannot land in `(0, 1)`.

Small, but it is the difference between a hypothesis that does work and one asserted to
work. The exponential stratum needs the half-line restriction and is not settled here. -/

/-! ### The link is a liability distribution

The classification's remaining step is an argument about measures, not about functions: a
bounded increasing `L` is the cdf of a finite measure on the liability axis, and the
averaging invariance says that measure reproduces itself, up to an affine change of
variable, under convolution with every Gaussian.  Only Gaussians do that.

This section builds the dictionary.  It is the step at which "link function" becomes
"distribution of the unmodelled liability", which is also what the object means
biologically: `L u` is the probability that total liability `u` plus everything the score
does not capture clears the threshold. -/

/-- **The link's two asymptotes are distinct.**

Strict monotonicity separates them, so the vertical scale `q = sup L - inf L` that
`link_rigidity` asks to be positive is positive for structural reasons: it is the total
mass of the liability distribution below.  A link with `q = 0` is a constant, which is not
strictly increasing. -/

/-- **The link is the cdf of a finite measure on the liability axis.**

A continuous increasing bounded `L` is a Stieltjes function; its Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure
`ν` is finite with total mass `sup L - inf L`, and `L u = inf L + ν (-∞, u]`.

This is the representation the classification runs on.  Once `L` is `inf L + ν(Iic ·)`, the
averaging identity
`∫ L (x + s z) dγ(z) = L (α x + β)`
says `ν` convolved with `N(0, s²)` equals `ν` pushed forward by an affine map — for every
`s`.  Reading it that way is what makes "only the Gaussian" a statement one can attack,
because self-similarity under all Gaussian convolutions is a condition on `ν`, not on `L`.

Biologically `ν` is the distribution of the liability the score does not model. The theorem
says that object always exists; `link_rigidity` is the claim that the invariance forces it
to be Gaussian. -/

/-- **Averaging the link is convolving its liability distribution.**

Through the representation `L u = p + ν (-∞, u]`, the Gaussian average of `L` at scale `s`
is the joint mass of the half-plane `{y ≤ x + s z}` under `ν ⊗ γ` — that is, the cdf at `x`
of `ν` convolved with `N(0, s²)`.

This is the change of viewpoint the classification needs.  On the left is an integral of an
unknown function; on the right is a measure evaluated on a half-plane, and the invariance
hypothesis of `link_rigidity` becomes: for every `s`, convolving `ν` with `N(0, s²)`
returns `ν` up to an affine change of variable.  Stated that way it is a self-similarity
condition on one measure, which is the form in which "only the Gaussian" is provable.

The proof is Fubini in its measure form — `Measure.prod_apply` slices the half-plane at
each `z` into exactly `Iic (x + s z)` — with the passage between the Bochner integral of
`toReal` and the lower integral justified by finiteness of `ν`. -/

This is the reduction the section was built for.  If the link's averaging family is closed
at scale `s` with parameters `(α, β)`, `α > 0`, then the liability distribution satisfies

`ν ⋆ N(0, s²)  =  ν pushed forward by  y ↦ (y - β)/α`.

No integral and no unknown function survive in it: an equation between two finite measures
on the line, holding at every scale.  The two sides are compared through their cdfs and
`Measure.ext_of_Iic` finishes, which is legitimate precisely because both are finite.

What is left of `link_rigidity` is exactly the classical statement that a finite measure
reproducing itself, up to affine change of variable, under convolution with every Gaussian
is Gaussian — on characteristic functions, `φ(ξ) e^{-s²ξ²/2} = e^{iβξ} φ(αξ)`.  That gap is
now self-contained, and is about characteristic functions rather than about an arbitrary
monotone link. -/

/-- **The classification, reduced to one equation on one function.**

Everything above collapses into this.  Write `φ` for the characteristic function of the
liability distribution `ν`.  If the link's averaging family is closed at scale `s` with
parameters `(α, β)`, then

`e^{-s²t²/2} · φ(t) = φ(t/α) · e^{-iβt/α}`  for every `t`.

This holds for every scale `s`, with `α` and `β` depending on `s`, and it is the whole
content of the invariance hypothesis of `link_rigidity`: no measure, no monotone function
and no Gaussian integral is left in it.

`φ(t) = e^{iμt - σ²t²/2}` solves it with `α = 1/√(1 + s²/σ²)`, and the classical fact is
that nothing else does: taking moduli kills the phase and gives
`|φ(t)| e^{-s²t²/2} = |φ(t/α)|`, which forces `log |φ|` to be quadratic.

Formalising that last implication — a Cauchy-type functional equation with regularity — is
the remaining gap in `link_rigidity`, and it is now a statement about a single continuous
function `ℝ → ℂ` rather than about links, measures or Gaussian integrals. -/

`link_rigidity` asserts an affine-probit representation exists. Before that is worth proving it
is worth knowing the representation is unique, because otherwise the conclusion names four
numbers that the data do not determine and the biological reading -- that `p` is a penetrance
floor and `p + q` a ceiling -- has nothing behind it.

Uniqueness is where the floor and the ceiling actually come from: they are the two tail limits
of the curve, which is why no amount of population drift can move them and why identifying them
needs tail calibration rather than dynamics. The horizontal parameters then follow from
injectivity.

Everything here is proved. -/

/-! ### Step three: the invariance cannot reverse or collapse the curve

The necessity argument normalises `L` by subtracting its floor and dividing by its scale, which
turns the invariance into a statement about a probability law. That normalisation is only
legitimate if the reparametrised slope the invariance produces is positive: a zero slope would
make the averaged curve constant, and a negative one would exchange the floor for the ceiling.

Neither is ruled out by the statement of the invariance, so both are ruled out here. The
argument is dominated convergence and nothing else -- the averaging weight is a probability
measure and the curve is bounded, so the tail limits pass through the integral. -/

open MeasureTheory ProbabilityTheory Filter Topology in
/-- **Gaussian averaging inherits whatever limit the liability curve has.**

Every displaced value is near the limit once `x` is far enough along the filter, and the
displacement has finite weight, so the average goes there too.  The floor and the ceiling
below are this theorem at `atBot` and at `atTop`; they were written out twice, and the two
copies differed only in the direction of three names. -/

The averaged curve has the same floor and the same ceiling as the original, and those differ.
A zero slope would make it constant and a negative one would swap the two, so neither survives.

This is the step that lets the necessity argument normalise: `(L - floor) / (ceiling - floor)`
is then a genuine distribution function and the invariance becomes a statement about adding an

/-! ### Step four: averaging cannot see a jump

`link_average_as_convolution` needs a liability measure `ν` with `L u = p + ν (Iic u)`, and a
monotone bounded curve carries one only if it is right-continuous. The hypotheses of
`link_rigidity` do not say that: `StrictMono` permits countably many jumps.

They do not have to say it. A monotone curve is discontinuous at only countably many points, an
affine change of variable with nonzero scale keeps that set countable, and the standard normal
assigns it no mass. So the Gaussian average of the curve is the Gaussian average of its
right-continuous version, and the jumps are invisible to the averaging that the invariance is
about. -/

/-! ### Step six: the self-similar law contracts, so its scale factor is below one

`charFun_selfSimilar_of_invariance` leaves one equation on one function. Solving it is an
iteration: substituting the equation into itself replaces `α` by `αⁿ`, and with `0 < α < 1` the
point `αⁿ u` runs to zero, where a characteristic function is its total mass. The limit then
evaluates the characteristic function in closed form and it is Gaussian.

That argument needs `α < 1`, which the invariance does not state. It is forced. Taking moduli in
the functional equation gives `‖ψ(u)‖ = ‖ψ(α u)‖ · exp(-(sαu)²/2)`, and iterating that bound with
`α ≥ 1` drives `‖ψ(u)‖` below `M · exp(-n (su)²/2)` for every `n`. So `ψ` would vanish off the
origin while equalling the total mass at it, and a characteristic function of a finite measure is
continuous. Mathlib does not carry that continuity, so it is proved here by dominated convergence
against the constant bound one. -/

`α < 1` three times: `αⁿ u` runs to zero, where a characteristic function is its total mass, and
the two partial sums run to `α²/(1-α²)` and `1/(1-α)`. The result is a closed form for the
characteristic function of the liability law, and it is a Gaussian one. -/

/-- **The irreducible analytic classification.**

Let `ν` be a nonzero finite liability measure.  Suppose that, after adding Gaussian noise of
every positive scale, its characteristic function is unchanged up to an orientation-preserving
affine change of liability coordinates.  Then the cdf of `ν` is a positive multiple of an
affine probit cdf.

This is the analytic core of the link classification, and it carries no external theorem
parameter and no arbitrary response curve: the input is one finite measure and the explicit
characteristic-function equation

`exp (-(s t)^2 / 2) · φ(t) = φ(t / a) · exp (-i b t / a)`.

It is proved.  `selfSimilar_alpha_lt_one` forces the
affine multiplier below one, and `charFun_selfSimilar_closed_form` evaluates the characteristic
function outright by iterating the equation: the Gaussian factors and the phases accumulate as
geometric series, and the limit is a Gaussian characteristic function with the variance and mean
exhibited.  No classification theorem is invoked. -/

/-- **Necessity: no other bounded link shape survives.** A strictly increasing bounded link whose
two-parameter family is closed under Gaussian averaging is a positive vertical affine transform
of the normal cdf composed with a positive affine map.

Proved, end to end, and not through the link's density: differentiating the invariance would
need smoothness these hypotheses do not supply. The link is the cdf of a liability measure
(`link_stieltjes_representation`), Gaussian averaging of the link is Gaussian blurring of that
measure (`link_average_as_convolution`), so the invariance says the measure is affinely
self-similar under blurring at every scale (`charFun_selfSimilar_of_invariance`), and only a
Gaussian is (`liability_cdf_eq_affineProbit_of_charFun_selfSimilar`). Boundedness is
load-bearing and does its work through the finiteness of that measure; it does not fix the
observation-channel floor and ceiling, which is why `p` and `q` remain in the conclusion. -/

/-! ## The evolution law of the response curve

Theorem 1 of the source analysis: in the frozen-mark coupling the marked and unmarked
subpopulations solve the SAME forward equation, so the response curve `c = q/p` obeys a
drift-diffusion equation whose drift is built from the OBSERVED marginal `p`. The marginal is not
a companion to the conditional; it is a coefficient in the conditional's own equation.

The computation is the product rule applied to `L*(cp) - c L*p` with `L*ρ = ½(aρ)'' - (bρ)'`, and
what survives is `(ap)'c' + ½ap c'' - bp c'`. Dividing by `p` gives the drift
`a' + a (log p)' - b`. Both steps are below: the first as an algebraic identity in the derivative
values, in the style this file already uses for the stationary collapse, and the second as the
division, which is where `p > 0` is needed.

Analytic hypotheses -- that the densities are twice differentiable and that the equation holds in
a genuine sense -- are not formalized here, and no semigroup is constructed. What is proved is the
identity those hypotheses would be used to obtain. -/

/-- **The response curve's transport identity.**

    With `a, a', a''`, `b, b'`, `c, c', c''` and `p, p', p''` standing for the values of the
    coefficients and their derivatives at a point, the second-order operator applied to the
    product `c p`, minus `c` times the same operator applied to `p`, collapses to a
    first-and-second-order expression in `c` alone. Every term carrying `c` undifferentiated
    cancels, which is why the result is an evolution equation FOR the curve rather than an
    identity constraining it. -/
theorem responseCurve_transport_identity
    (a a' a'' b b' c c' c'' p p' p'' : ℝ) :
    (a'' * (c * p) + 2 * a' * (c' * p + c * p') + a * (c'' * p + 2 * c' * p' + c * p'')) / 2
        - (b' * (c * p) + b * (c' * p + c * p'))
        - c * ((a'' * p + 2 * a' * p' + a * p'') / 2 - (b' * p + b * p'))
      = (a' * p + a * p') * c' + a * p * c'' / 2 - b * p * c' := by
  ring

/-- **The marginal appears in the conditional's drift.**

    Dividing the transport identity by the population density turns `(a'p + a p')/p` into
    `a' + a (log p)'`, written here as `a' + a * (p'/p)` since the logarithmic derivative is
    exactly that quotient. The drift the curve feels is therefore assembled from the observed
    marginal and the generator's own coefficients, and at `p ≡ π` stationary it collapses back to
    `b` by `stationaryDrift_collapses_to_generator`. -/

/-! ## The probit realization dynamics

The one piece of the continuum realization theory that is calculus rather than analysis. Under
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck drift the probit family `Φ(a x + b)` is exactly invariant, and its parameters
obey `ȧ = -λ a - a³/2`. That planar system looks nonlinear and is not: the substitution
`A = a⁻²` linearises it to `Ȧ = 2λA + 1`, which is why the realization is integrable in closed
form rather than merely finite-dimensional.

What is proved here is exactly that substitution. The invariance of the family itself is also
proved, and this paragraph used to say it was not: `gaussianAverage_probit` IS the Gaussian
identity `E[Φ(α + βZ)] = Φ(α/√(1+β²))`, and `probit_invariant_under_ou` is the OU step. Both are
above, in this file. -/

/-- **The inverse-square substitution linearises the probit realization flow.**

    If the slope parameter obeys `ȧ = -λ a - a³/2`, then `A = a⁻²` obeys `Ȧ = 2λ A + 1`. The
    nonlinearity is a coordinate artifact: the realization dynamics are affine, hence solvable in
    closed form, which is what makes the two-dimensional invariant family explicit rather than
    merely existent. -/

/-- **At stationarity the curve's transport drift is the generator's own drift.**

    The response curve moves with drift `a' + a (log p)' - b`, built from the observed population
    density `p`. Under reversibility the stationary density satisfies `b = a'/2 + a (log π)'/2`,
    and substituting it returns `b`: the drifting equation collapses to the generator. This is
    the algebraic step behind "at stationarity the curve flows by the semigroup itself", and it
    is the only continuum computation in this file that is pure algebra. -/
