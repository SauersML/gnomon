# Polygenic Adaptation and PGS Portability

This file formalizes how polygenic adaptation — coordinated allele
frequency changes across many loci under selection — affects PGS
portability. Polygenic adaptation is subtle but can systematically
bias PGS predictions across populations.

Key results:
1. QST-FST test for polygenic selection
2. Polygenic score overdispersion under selection
3. Directional selection on PGS-relevant traits
4. Stabilizing vs directional selection effects
5. Detecting adaptation from GWAS summary statistics

## QST-FST Comparison

QST measures phenotypic differentiation between populations for
quantitative traits. Comparing QST to FST detects selection:
QST > FST → directional selection, QST < FST → stabilizing selection.
-/

section QSTFSTTest

/-- **QST definition.**
    QST = V_between / (V_between + 2 × V_within)
    where V_between and V_within are between- and within-population
    additive genetic variance components. -/
noncomputable def qst (V_between V_within : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  V_between / (V_between + 2 * V_within)

/-- QST is in [0, 1] for nonneg components with positive denominator. -/
theorem qst_in_unit (V_b V_w : ℝ)
    (h_b : 0 ≤ V_b) (h_w : 0 < V_w) :
    0 ≤ qst V_b V_w ∧ qst V_b V_w ≤ 1 := by
  unfold qst

  constructor
  · exact div_nonneg h_b (le_of_lt h_denom)
  · rw [div_le_one h_denom]; linarith

/- **QST >> FST indicates directional selection.**
   When QST exceeds FST by a margin δ > 0, this indicates
   directional selection has driven trait divergence beyond
   what neutral drift (FST) would predict.

   Worked example: For immune traits, QST greatly exceeds FST due to
   pathogen-driven selection that disrupts genetic architecture. -/

## Polygenic Score Overdispersion

Under polygenic adaptation, the PGS mean differences between
populations exceed what's expected from drift alone.
-/

section PGSOverdispersion

/-- **PGS drift variance in a single population.**

    **Derivation from drift theory:**
    - PGS = Σᵢ βᵢ × Gᵢ, so under drift E[ΔPGS] = Σᵢ βᵢ × E[Δpᵢ] = 0
      (drift is unbiased on allele frequencies).
    - Var(ΔPGS) = Σᵢ βᵢ² × Var(Δpᵢ)     (independent loci)
                = Σᵢ βᵢ² × 2pᵢ(1-pᵢ) × Fst  (definition of Fst)
                = Fst × Σᵢ 2pᵢ(1-pᵢ)βᵢ²
                = Fst × V_A              (definition of additive genetic variance)

    This gives the variance of PGS change in one population due to drift. -/
noncomputable def pgsDriftVariance_one_pop (V_A fst : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  fst * V_A

/-- Single-population PGS drift variance is nonneg. -/
theorem pgsDriftVariance_one_pop_nonneg (V_A fst : ℝ)
    (h_VA : 0 ≤ V_A) (h_fst : 0 ≤ fst) :
    0 ≤ pgsDriftVariance_one_pop V_A fst := by
  unfold pgsDriftVariance_one_pop; positivity

/-- **PGS difference variance between two independently drifting populations.**

    For two populations that diverged from a common ancestor and drifted
    independently:
    - Var(PGS₁ - PGS₂) = Var(PGS₁) + Var(PGS₂)  (independence of drift)
                        = Fst × V_A + Fst × V_A
                        = 2 × Fst × V_A
                        = 2 × pgsDriftVariance_one_pop(V_A, Fst)

    The factor of 2 arises because both populations drift independently
    from their common ancestor, analogous to the factor of 2 in
    expectedFreqDiffSq for allele frequency differences. -/
noncomputable def pgsDiffVariance_two_pop (V_A fst : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  2 * pgsDriftVariance_one_pop V_A fst

/-- Two-population PGS difference variance decomposes as sum of
    independent single-population drift variances. -/
theorem pgsDiffVariance_two_pop_eq_sum (V_A fst : ℝ) :
    pgsDiffVariance_two_pop V_A fst =
      pgsDriftVariance_one_pop V_A fst + pgsDriftVariance_one_pop V_A fst := by
  unfold pgsDiffVariance_two_pop; ring

/-- **Expected PGS mean difference under drift.**
    Under pure drift, the PGS mean difference has variance:
    Var(ΔPGS) = V_A × 2FST.
    The expected |ΔPGS| ∝ √(V_A × FST). -/
noncomputable def expectedPGSDiffVariance (V_A fst : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  V_A * 2 * fst

/-- **The two-population PGS difference variance equals expectedPGSDiffVariance.**

    This connects the step-by-step derivation to the original definition:
    pgsDiffVariance_two_pop V_A fst
      = 2 × (fst × V_A)          (unfolding pgsDriftVariance_one_pop)
      = V_A × 2 × fst            (commutativity of multiplication)
      = expectedPGSDiffVariance V_A fst -/
theorem pgsDiffVariance_eq_expected (V_A fst : ℝ) :
    pgsDiffVariance_two_pop V_A fst = expectedPGSDiffVariance V_A fst := by
  unfold pgsDiffVariance_two_pop pgsDriftVariance_one_pop expectedPGSDiffVariance
  ring

/-- Expected variance is nonneg. -/
theorem expected_pgs_diff_var_nonneg (V_A fst : ℝ)
    (h_VA : 0 ≤ V_A) (h_fst : 0 ≤ fst) :
    0 ≤ expectedPGSDiffVariance V_A fst := by
  unfold expectedPGSDiffVariance; positivity

/-- **Overdispersion test.**
    If the observed PGS difference is significantly larger than
    expected under drift, there is evidence of polygenic adaptation.
    Test statistic: χ² = (ΔPGS)² / (V_A × 2FST). -/
noncomputable def overdispersionStatistic (delta_pgs V_A fst : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  delta_pgs ^ 2 / expectedPGSDiffVariance V_A fst

/-- **Overdispersion → portability loss.**
    If the observed PGS difference exceeds the drift expectation,
    the χ² statistic (ΔPGS² / drift_variance) exceeds the critical value.
    We derive significance from the raw quantities. -/

  rwa [lt_div_iff₀ h_drift_pos]

/-- **Population stratification confounds overdispersion tests.**
    Cryptic stratification in the GWAS discovery sample can
    create spurious PGS differences that look like adaptation.

    We prove the substantive claim: stratification bias can make a
    non-significant true signal appear significant. Specifically, if
    the true χ² statistic (delta_true² / drift_var) does not exceed
    the critical value, but the confounded signal (delta_true + bias)²
    is large enough, then the confounded χ² *does* exceed the critical
    value — a false positive for polygenic adaptation. -/

      critical < (delta_true + strat_bias) ^ 2 / drift_var := by
  exact ⟨h_not_sig, by rwa [lt_div_iff₀ h_drift_pos]⟩

/-- **Correction for LD and ascertainment.**
    The naive overdispersion test is biased because:
    1. LD amplifies signal at correlated SNPs
    2. Ascertainment of GWAS hits creates winner's curse
    Both biases inflate the test statistic.

    We prove the substantive claim: after subtracting positive LD and
    ascertainment biases from the naive statistic, the corrected value
    is strictly smaller than the naive value AND still positive (when
    the biases are less than the naive statistic). -/

## Directional vs Stabilizing Selection

The type of selection determines how genetic architecture
changes across populations.
-/

section SelectionTypes

/-- **Directional selection shifts allele frequencies.**
    Under directional selection for higher trait values,
    alleles that increase the trait become more common.
    A nonzero selection coefficient s on a trait with additive
    genetic variance V_A shifts the PGS mean by s × V_A per generation;
    after t generations the mean differs from neutral. -/
theorem directional_selection_shifts_pgs
    (pgs_mean_neutral s V_A : ℝ) (t : ℕ)
    (h_s : s ≠ 0) (h_VA : 0 < V_A) (h_t : 0 < t) :

    exact Nat.cast_ne_zero.mpr (by omega)
  intro h_eq
  have h_zero : s * V_A * t = 0 := by linarith
  exact this h_zero

/-- **Stabilizing selection maintains architecture.**
    Under stabilizing selection toward the same optimum, extreme-effect
    alleles are removed in all populations. The remaining architecture
    is similar, yielding better portability.

    We model effect correlation as ρ = 1 - drift/(drift + selection),
    where drift = 1/(2N) and selection strength s determines how quickly
    deviations from the optimum are corrected. We prove: for any positive
    selection strength and population size, the effect correlation under
    stabilizing selection (ρ_stab) exceeds the neutral correlation (ρ_neutral),
    and ρ_stab is bounded below by s·N/(1 + s·N).

    The neutral correlation under pure drift with divergence parameter d
    is 1 - d, while under stabilizing selection with strength s the
    effective decorrelation is reduced to d/(1 + s·N), giving
    ρ_stab = 1 - d/(1 + s·N) > 1 - d = ρ_neutral. -/

/-- **Fluctuating selection is worst for portability.**
    Under the drift-selection model:

    - Neutral drift:         ρ = 1 - d              (no restoration)
    - Fluctuating selection:  ρ = 1 - d·(1 + f·N)   (selection accelerates divergence)

    where d is the drift parameter, s is stabilizing selection strength,
    f is the fluctuation intensity, and N is effective population size.
    We derive the full ordering: ρ_fluctuating < ρ_neutral < ρ_stabilizing. -/

/-- **Selection strength determines portability impact.**
    Weak selection (s << 1/(2Ne)): alleles behave neutrally → portable.
    Strong selection (s >> 1/(2Ne)): alleles are population-specific → not portable.
    Weak and strong selection regimes cannot overlap: if s < ne_inv

## Detecting Adaptation from GWAS Summary Statistics

Modern methods detect polygenic adaptation directly from
GWAS effect sizes and allele frequencies.

section DetectingAdaptation

/- **Turchin et al. height signal.**
    Height-increasing alleles are systematically more common
    in Northern Europeans. This was initially interpreted as
    evidence of directional selection for height. -/

/- **Berg-Coop test for polygenic adaptation.**
    Tests whether the variance of trait-associated allele frequencies
    exceeds neutral expectation, accounting for population structure. -/

/-- **The height adaptation signal partially confounded.**
    Sohail et al. (2019) showed that much of the apparent height
    adaptation signal was due to residual stratification in UKBiobank.
    After correction, the signal was greatly reduced. -/

    0 < signal_raw - strat_bias ∧ signal_raw - strat_bias < signal_raw := by
  exact ⟨by linarith, by linarith⟩

/-- **Implications for portability.**
    If apparent adaptation is actually stratification, then the portability
    loss observed is partly artifactual. If we define apparent portability
    as true portability minus a positive stratification bias, then the apparent
    portability is strictly less than the true portability. -/

    Selection on one trait affects correlated traits via pleiotropy.
    If the absolute difference in portability between two traits is bounded
    by 2(1 - |r_g|), where r_g is their genetic correlation, then as
    their genetic correlation increases, their portability gap is more tightly bounded. -/
