# Marked successful families are the branching-front universality object

The broad Brunet--Derrida universality claim cannot be expressed by one universal coalescent
measure or one universal clock.  The exact model-independent reduction starts one level higher.
A successful reproductive event has two marks: its eventual population fraction `x` and the
front displacement `r` it causes.  Its limiting intensity is a measure `ν` on `(x,r)`.

This file formalizes the consequences that follow *after* such a marked-event limit is known:

* `genealogyMeasure ν` is the weighted fraction marginal `Λ₀(dx) = x² ν(dx, ℝ)`;
* a speed tilt produces `speedTiltedGenealogyMeasure θ ν`, with weight `x² exp(-θr)`;
* the successful-family participation probability is exactly the corresponding
  `Λ`-coalescent integrand;
* the Beta interpolation follows from, and requires at transform level, a logarithmic response
  in the surviving population fraction;
* two displacement responses with the same unconditioned genealogy have different tilted
  three-lineage rates;
* the pioneer change of variables produces both the inverse-square family intensity and the
  front-width timescale.

No theorem below asserts the missing model-specific point-process convergence for an `N`-BRW or
`N`-BBM.  In particular, the file does not promote the still-open light-tailed hard-selection
genealogy limit to an axiom.  It formalizes exactly what that convergence would imply.
