# Variance Components, Heritability, and PGS Performance

This file formalizes the relationship between variance components,
heritability estimation, and PGS performance across populations.

Key results:
1. GREML heritability estimation and its assumptions
2. h² SNP vs h² twin and the missing heritability problem
3. Variance component changes across populations
4. Heritability is population-specific
5. PGS R² ceiling from heritability

Provenance: derived here, not imported. Wang et al. (2026), Nature Communications 17:942,
substantiates nothing below. It is an empirical study of the polygenic-score portability
gap and does not treat GREML estimation, missing heritability or the
population-specificity of h2. Sources for individual results, where they exist, are cited
at those results.

## Heritability Definitions and Relationships

Different definitions of heritability lead to different ceilings
for PGS performance.
-/

section HeritabilityDefinitions

/-- **Narrow-sense heritability.**
    h² = V_A / V_P where V_A is additive genetic variance
    and V_P = V_A + V_D + V_I + V_E is total phenotypic variance. -/

  V_A / (V_A + V_D + V_I + V_E)

    (h_total : 0 < V_A + V_D + V_I + V_E) :
    0 ≤ narrowSenseH2 V_A V_D V_I V_E ∧

  · exact div_nonneg hA (le_of_lt h_total)
  · rw [div_le_one h_total]; linarith

/-- **SNP heritability.**
    h²_SNP = V_A_tagged / V_P ≤ h²_narrow.
    Only the variance tagged by genotyped SNPs is captured. -/
noncomputable def snpH2 (V_A_tagged V_P : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  V_A_tagged / V_P

/-- SNP heritability ≤ narrow-sense heritability. -/
theorem snp_h2_le_narrow_h2
    (V_A_tagged V_A_total V_D V_I V_E : ℝ)
    (h_tagged : V_A_tagged ≤ V_A_total)
    (h_total : 0 < V_A_total + V_D + V_I + V_E) :
    snpH2 V_A_tagged (V_A_total + V_D + V_I + V_E) ≤

  unfold snpH2 narrowSenseH2
  exact div_le_div_of_nonneg_right h_tagged (le_of_lt h_total)

/-- **The tagging gap, as an identity rather than an inequality.**

    `snp_h2_le_narrow_h2` says only that the SNP heritability is the smaller of
    the two. How much smaller is not an estimate: the difference is the untagged
    additive variance over the phenotypic variance, on the nose. The one-sided
    statement is the corollary obtained by discarding the sign information in
    the numerator, and with it goes the ability to say when the two coincide,
    which is now visible — never, unless the tagging is complete. -/

    (V_A_tagged V_A_total V_D V_I V_E : ℝ) :

  unfold snpH2 narrowSenseH2
  rw [div_sub_div_same]

/-- **The missing heritability gap.**
    h²_twin - h²_SNP > 0 for most traits. This is the "missing heritability".
    It sets an upper bound on what PGS can achieve with current genotyping.

    We derive the gap from the variance component model: h²_twin captures
    V_A_total / V_P while h²_SNP captures only V_A_tagged / V_P. The gap
    arises whenever some additive variance is not tagged by genotyped SNPs
    (V_A_untagged > 0). We prove that h²_twin - h²_SNP = V_A_untagged / V_P > 0,
    connecting the gap to the concrete untagged variance component.

    **Strengthened to the equality the docstring already claimed.** The
    conclusion was `0 < h2_twin - h2_snp`, one-sided, while the text above it
    asserted the identity. The identity is now in the statement and the
    positivity is its corollary, so a reader of the signature no longer has to
    take the numerator on trust. -/

## Population-Specific Heritability

Heritability is NOT a fixed property of a trait — it depends on
allele frequencies, LD structure, and environmental variance
in the specific population.
-/

section PopulationSpecificH2

/-- **Additive variance under LINKAGE EQUILIBRIUM** — the qualifier is load-bearing and was
    missing.

    `V_A = Σᵢ 2pᵢ(1-pᵢ)αᵢ²` drops the LD cross term `Σᵢ≠ⱼ 4·αᵢ·αⱼ·D_ij`, so it is correct only
    at `D = 0` and is stated unconditionally. **The sign of the error flips with the sign of
    the effect product**, which is why no constant repairs it: at `p = 1/2`, `D = 1/8`, exact
    rationals, `α = (1,1)` gives `1` against a true `3/2` (ratio `2/3`), while `α = (1,-1)`
    gives `1` against a true `1/2` (ratio `2`).

    Simulation at `n = 400k` reproduces both: `1.4975` against the LD-inclusive `1.5`, with a
    `D = 0` control at `0.9974` against `1.0`.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED at linkage equilibrium**; the unconditional reading is
    **FALSIFIED** (`proofs/validation/empirical/ldsc_diff/`). -/

/-! ### Why the variance components are the easy summaries

`additiveVariance` is a quadratic — hence smooth — functional of the effect
vector, and so are `narrowSenseH2`, `snpH2` and every component appearing in
the ceiling results below. Smooth functionals of this kind are estimable at
polynomial rates, and the sample-size laws in `Calibrator.PowerAnalysis` are
the right shape for them.

That is a property of these particular summaries and does not extend to the
whole file's subject matter. A summary of the same effect vector that is not
smooth — the mean absolute effect, or an inverse-kurtosis polygenicity measure
— may carry a logarithmic benchmark rather than a power of `q` in a specified
Gaussian-sequence model; see
`Calibrator.PolygenicArchitecture`, section `NonsmoothSummaries`. The
distinction is invisible in the formulas, which look equally elementary, and it
is worth stating here because the two kinds of quantity are routinely reported
side by side in the same table with the same standard errors. -/

/-- **Frequency change affects additive variance.**
    When MAF changes from p to p' at a single locus,
    the contribution to V_A changes. -/

## PGS R² Ceiling

## GREML Estimation and Bias

GREML (Genomic REML) estimates h² from GRM. Its accuracy depends
on LD and population structure assumptions.
-/

section GREML

/-- **A quantity plus a nonzero offset differs from the quantity.**

    The name says what is proved. The GREML reading — that using linkage-disequilibrium
    structure from one population to estimate heritability in another leaves a nonzero bias —
    is the reason someone would supply `h_ld_nonzero`, and it is not derived here: no genomic
    relationship matrix, no phenotypic covariance and no estimator appears below. That the bias
    is nonzero is the hypothesis, so this cannot be cited as evidence that GREML is
    LD-sensitive. -/

/-- **GREML underestimates h² when causal variants are poorly tagged.**
    The true SNP heritability is `V_A / V_P`, while GREML only captures
    the tagged additive variance `(mean_tag_r2 * V_A) / V_P`. If tagging is
    imperfect, the underestimation gap is exactly
    `((1 - mean_tag_r2) * V_A) / V_P > 0`. -/

/-- **Population structure inflates GREML h² estimate.**
    Cryptic stratification in the GWAS sample creates a positive bias
    in the GRM-based h² estimate.

    **Model:** GREML estimates h² = V_A / V_P by fitting a linear mixed
    model with a GRM kernel. When there is population structure, the GRM
    captures both true genetic relatedness and stratification-induced
    correlations. The GREML estimate becomes:
      h²_GREML = (V_A + V_strat) / (V_A + V_strat + V_E)
    while the true h² is:
      h²_true = V_A / (V_A + V_strat + V_E)

    We derive: h²_GREML > h²_true whenever V_strat > 0, because
    (V_A + V_strat)/V_P > V_A/V_P when V_P > 0.

    **Strengthened from a direction to a magnitude.** The inflation is not
    merely positive; it equals the stratification variance as a fraction of the
    phenotypic variance, `V_strat / V_P`, with no residual term. That is what
    makes the bias correctable in principle from an estimate of `V_strat`
    alone, which the one-sided form could not support. -/

## Liability Scale Conversion

For binary traits, h² on the observed scale differs from h² on
the liability scale. Conversion depends on prevalence.
-/

section LiabilityScale

/-- **Observed-to-liability scale conversion (Dempster-Lee-Risch).**

    **Derivation of the Dempster-Lee-Risch conversion:**

    On the liability scale, assume Y ~ N(0, 1). Disease occurs when Y > T,
    where T = Φ⁻¹(1-K) and K = prevalence. This is the "liability threshold
    model."

    The key question: how does a unit change in liability translate to a
    change in disease risk on the observed (binary 0/1) scale?

    1. The observed (binary) heritability h²_obs measures variance explained
       on the 0/1 disease scale.

    2. The liability heritability h²_liab measures variance explained on the
       continuous latent liability scale.

    3. The relationship between the two involves the "ascertainment correction"
       factor. At the threshold T, the standard normal density is z = φ(T).
       A small shift δ in mean liability changes disease risk by:
         ΔP(disease) ≈ z × δ

    4. Variance on observed scale vs liability scale:
       - A genetic variant explaining variance σ² on the liability scale
         explains variance ≈ z² × σ² / (K(1-K)) on the observed scale
         (after accounting for the Bernoulli variance K(1-K) of the binary outcome).

    5. Therefore: h²_obs = h²_liab × z² / (K(1-K))

    6. Rearranging: **h²_liab = h²_obs × K(1-K) / z²**

    The factor K(1-K)/z² is the inverse of the "ascertainment correction,"
    which accounts for the nonlinear mapping between the continuous liability
    and binary disease status. For rare diseases (small K), the threshold T
    is far in the tail, z = φ(T) is small, and z² << K(1-K), so
    h²_liab >> h²_obs.

    Empirical status: UNTESTED. -/
