# Near-optimal geometry under landscape superposition

This file formalizes the exact level-resolved decomposition that governs overlap-gap
persistence under a positive superposition of finite landscapes.  It deliberately separates
the easy direction from the hard one:

* `nearOptimal_superposition_iff_exists_levels` is an equality of configuration sets;
* `superposedAchievableOverlap_subset_levelResolved` is the induced one-sided inclusion for
  achievable overlaps;
* `forbiddenOverlap_of_levelResolved_cover` and
  `forbiddenInterval_of_levelResolved_cover` certify persistence of a forbidden overlap or
  interval;
* no converse is asserted.  Dissolution requires constructing common configurations and does
  not follow from this set calculus.

The final section checks the polynomial arithmetic behind the spherical calibration example.
It proves that each idiosyncratic tail has a negative endpoint certificate while their
half-weight covariance mixture has a strictly positive certificate throughout `[0, 1]`.
No external spin-glass criterion is accepted as a theorem parameter; only the polynomial fact
that such a criterion would consume is formalized here.

configuration, but different covariance energies.  Thus an anisotropic first-moment theory
cannot project to overlap alone; its state space must retain both `(ρ, r)`. -/
