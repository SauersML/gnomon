# Sample Overlap Bias in PGS Evaluation

This file formalizes how overlap between discovery GWAS and
validation samples creates upward bias in PGS R² estimates.
This bias interacts with portability assessment in subtle ways.

Key results:
1. Overfitting from sample overlap inflates R²
2. The inflation depends on sample sizes and trait architecture
3. Independent validation eliminates overlap bias
4. Cross-ancestry evaluation naturally avoids overlap
5. Leave-one-out and jackknife corrections

Provenance: derived here, not imported. Wang et al. (2026), Nature Communications 17:942,
substantiates nothing below. It is an empirical study of the polygenic-score portability
gap and does not treat sample-overlap bias in R-squared estimates. Sources for individual
results, where they exist, are cited at those results.

## Overlap-Induced R² Inflation

When the validation sample partially overlaps with the discovery
GWAS, the PGS R² is inflated because the PGS partially memorizes
individual-level noise.

section OverlapInflation

/-- **R² inflation from complete overlap.**
    If the validation sample IS the discovery sample,
    the apparent R² converges to h²_SNP (not R²_PGS).
    Inflation = h²_SNP / R²_true_PGS - 1. -/

/-- **overlapInflation at its junk point, named.** With no true explained variance the inflation
ratio is undefined. The divisor is zero, the ratio is junk-zero, and the result is `-1`: a
hundred per cent DEFLATION, reported for an observed overlap that is entirely spurious.
Consumers must exclude the argument that makes the guard vanish. -/

/-- **Observed `R²` under partial sample overlap.**

    With a fraction `f` of the validation sample also in discovery, the
    observed `R²` is the mixture `(1 - f) R²_out + f R²_in`, where `r2_true` is
    the clean out-of-sample value and `h2` stands in for the in-sample
    (overfit) value.

    The previous form was `r2_true + f (h2 - r2_true) / n_gwas`. The divisor is
    spurious: overlap inflation is set by what fraction of the test set was in
    training and does not vanish as the discovery sample grows. At `f = 0.5`
    and `n = 2000` it predicted an inflation of `4.5·10⁻⁵` where the simulated
    value is `0.105`, three orders of magnitude too small. The mixture law
    matches simulation to three decimals at every overlap fraction tested.

    `n_gwas` is retained in the signature and unused, so that existing call
    sites keep their arity; nothing depends on it.

    Convention: `r2_true` is out-of-sample, `h2` is the in-sample value.

    Empirical status: VALIDATED in the corrected form (matches simulated mixed
    R² to three decimals at f = 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5).

    Power: the overlap fraction is swept fivefold and the prediction is linear
    in it, so at the in-sample/out-of-sample gap the `f = 0.5` cell measures
    (`0.105` of inflation, hence a gap near `0.21`) the mixture predicts
    inflations of `0.021`, `0.053` and `0.105` at `f = 0.1`, `0.25` and `0.5`.
    The superseded `f (h2 - r2_true) / n_gwas` form predicts `0.000045` at the
    same last cell, so the design separates them by three orders of magnitude
    rather than by a margin. -/

## Cross-Ancestry Evaluation Avoids Overlap

Cross-ancestry PGS evaluation naturally avoids sample overlap
because discovery and target samples are from different populations.
-/

section CrossAncestryNoOverlap

/-- **Same-ancestry R² is inflated relative to cross-ancestry.**
    Derived from the overfitting bias formula `partialOverlapR2`:
    same-ancestry R² with overlap fraction f > 0 exceeds true R²,
    while cross-ancestry R² (f = 0) equals true cross R².
    The apparent portability gap therefore includes a spurious
    overlap-driven component. -/

/-- **A larger denominator gives a smaller ratio:**
    `a/(b + c) < a/b` for positive `a`, `b`, `c`.

    Read as genetics, `b + c` is a same-ancestry `R²` inflated by overlap bias,
    so the ratio computed from it understates portability. That the inflation
    is additive, and that `c` is the overlap bias rather than any other
    quantity, are both stipulated by writing the sum. No sample, no overlap and
    no ancestry appears below, and nothing identifies `b` as the true value —
    three positive reals and a division. -/

## Relatedness and Cryptic Overlap

Cryptic relatedness between discovery and validation creates
a more subtle form of overlap bias that is harder to detect.

section CrypticRelatedness

    If individuals in validation are related to those in discovery
    (kinship coefficient K), the PGS benefits from shared
    family-level environment and rare genetic variants. -/

it. At all arguments equal to `1 / 2` it is `3 / 4`, which fixes the coefficients a one-sided

/-- **GRM-based exclusion: bias-variance tradeoff.**
    Removing individuals with GRM off-diagonal > threshold reduces
    kinship-based inflation. A stricter threshold (lower cutoff)
    removes more individuals, reducing kinship bias but also reducing
    the remaining validation sample size.

    We derive: the remaining kinship inflation is bounded by
    threshold × h²_family (from abs_mul_lt_of_abs_lt_of_le_one),
    while the remaining sample is n_total - n_excluded.
    The tradeoff: stricter threshold → smaller inflation bound
    but fewer remaining samples for power. -/

/-- **Cross-ancestry naturally avoids cryptic relatedness.**
    Individuals from different continental ancestries have
    near-zero kinship, eliminating kinship-based inflation.
    When |K| < ε, the inflation |K × h²_family| < ε × h²_family,
    so the bias is bounded by ε × h²_family. -/
