### Derivation: Stabilizing Selection Reduces Fst at Causal Loci

Under the Wright-Fisher model, neutral allele frequency drift gives
  Fst_neutral = 1 - (1 - 1/(2*Ne))^t

where Ne is the effective population size and t is the number of generations.
The factor (1 - 1/(2*Ne))^t is the probability that two lineages have NOT
coalesced by generation t -- i.e., the fraction of heterozygosity remaining.

Under stabilizing selection with coefficient s > 0, alleles at causal loci
experience selection pressure that constrains frequency changes. The effective
drift rate is reduced: instead of losing heterozygosity at rate 1/(2*Ne) per
generation, the per-generation loss is 1/(2*Ne) - s_correction, where
s_correction > 0 captures selection maintaining polymorphism.

Concretely, define:
  neutralDriftFactor(Ne, t)      = (1 - 1/(2*Ne))^t
  selectedDriftFactor(Ne, t, s)  = (1 - 1/(2*Ne) + s_correction)^t

where 0 < s_correction < 1/(2*Ne), so the selected drift factor per
generation is strictly larger (closer to 1) than the neutral one.

Since heterozygosity_selected = H_0 * selectedDriftFactor > H_0 * neutralDriftFactor = heterozygosity_neutral,
and Fst = 1 - H_between / H_total = 1 - driftFactor (in the island model),
we get:

  Fst_selected = 1 - selectedDriftFactor < 1 - neutralDriftFactor = Fst_neutral

This is the formal justification for the hypothesis fst_causal < fst_neutral
used in the portability theorem below.
-/

/-- **Neutral drift factor per generation.**
    Under Wright-Fisher, the probability of NOT coalescing in one generation
    is (1 - 1/(2*Ne)). The fraction of heterozygosity remaining after t
    generations is this quantity raised to the t-th power. -/
noncomputable def neutralDriftFactor (Ne : ℝ) (t : ℕ) : ℝ :=
  (1 - 1 / (2 * Ne)) ^ t

/-- **Selected drift factor per generation.**
    Under stabilizing selection with correction s_correction > 0, the
    per-generation heterozygosity retention is higher:
    (1 - 1/(2*Ne) + s_correction)^t.
    The s_correction term reflects selection maintaining polymorphism
    at causal loci, reducing the effective drift rate. -/
noncomputable def selectedDriftFactor (Ne : ℝ) (t : ℕ) (s_correction : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  (1 - 1 / (2 * Ne) + s_correction) ^ t

/-- **Fst from a drift factor.**
    In the island/drift model, Fst = 1 - driftFactor, where driftFactor
    is the fraction of ancestral heterozygosity retained. -/
noncomputable def fstFromDriftFactor (driftFactor : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  1 - driftFactor

/-- **Selected drift factor exceeds neutral drift factor.**
    Since s_correction > 0, the per-generation retention rate is strictly
    higher for selected loci, and raising to the t-th power preserves
    the strict inequality (for t ≥ 1). -/

/-- **Stabilizing selection reduces Fst at causal loci.**
    From the drift factor inequality, we derive:
    Fst_selected = 1 - selectedDriftFactor < 1 - neutralDriftFactor = Fst_neutral.

    This is the key population genetics result: stabilizing selection
    maintains shared polymorphism across populations, reducing divergence
    at causal loci relative to neutral sites. -/

/-- **Stabilizing selection model.**
    Under stabilizing selection toward the same optimum in both populations,
    the cross-population genetic correlation r_g exceeds the neutral expectation
    (1 - Fst), because selection purges divergent alleles.

    Parameters:
    - r_g: cross-population genetic correlation under stabilizing selection
    - fst: population divergence measure
    - ld_factor: LD tagging correction
    - r2_source: source-population PGS R²

    Portability = r2_source * (1 - fst) * r_g² * ld_factor
    Neutral portability = r2_source * (1 - fst) * 1² * ld_factor  (since ρ = 1 under neutrality)

    When stabilizing selection keeps r_g > 1 is impossible, but the mechanism
    is that stabilizing selection *maintains* shared architecture better than
    drift alone. We model this as: under stabilizing selection, the effective
    Fst for causal variants is reduced (Fst_causal < Fst_neutral).

    The hypothesis `h_stabilizing : fst_causal < fst_neutral` is now derived
    from first principles in `fst_causal_lt_fst_neutral_of_stabilizing_selection`
    above, via the Wright-Fisher drift model with stabilizing selection correction. -/

/-- **Diversifying selection model.**
    Under diversifying (balancing/pathogen-driven) selection, the
    cross-population effect correlation ρ < 1 because selection
    pushes allele frequencies and effect sizes apart.

    The key structural parameter is ρ (effect correlation).
    Neutral model: ρ = 1 (effects identical across populations).
    Diversifying selection: ρ < 1 (effects diverge).

    Portability_observed = r2_source * (1 - fst) * ρ² * ld_factor
    Portability_neutral  = r2_source * (1 - fst) * 1  * ld_factor

    Since ρ < 1, we derive ρ² < 1, hence observed < neutral. -/

## Immune Trait Portability

Immune-related traits consistently show worse portability than
neutral expectation, reflecting pathogen-driven divergent selection.
-/

section ImmuneTraits

/-- **Genomic region dominates trait architecture disproportionately.**
    A genomic region that occupies a small fraction of the genome can
    contribute a disproportionately large fraction of genetic variance
    for traits under strong selection in that region. When the region's
    SNP fraction is below some bound and its variance fraction exceeds
    that bound, the region is enriched.

    Worked example: HLA region (~6p21) contains <1% of SNPs but >10%
    of immune trait variance due to balancing/diversifying selection. -/

/-- **Trait portability is bounded by effect correlation.**
    For any trait under population-specific selection (e.g., pathogen-driven
    for immune traits), the cross-population effect correlation ρ
    is reduced from a baseline by δ_selection > 0. Given any baseline ρ₀,
    the post-selection correlation ρ₀ - δ is strictly less than ρ₀.

    Worked example: For immune traits, ρ_baseline > 0.9 but pathogen-driven
    selection can reduce it substantially (e.g., WBC, lymphocyte count). -/

/-- **Selection-driven portability falls below neutral expectation.**
    For any trait where observed portability is below a threshold and the
    neutral prediction exceeds that threshold, the trait's portability is
    strictly below the neutral expectation. This gap indicates the presence
    of non-neutral forces (e.g., directional selection, GxE interactions).

    Worked example: WBC portability EUR→AFR is ~20-30% of source R²,
    while neutral prediction gives ~85%. The gap is from the Duffy null
    variant (DARC/ACKR1) with large frequency differences due to malaria selection. -/

## Metabolic Trait Portability

Metabolic traits show intermediate portability, reflecting
dietary adaptation across populations.
-/

section MetabolicTraits

/- **Lactase persistence as a portability example.**
    The LCT locus (2q21) has dramatically different frequencies
    across populations due to dairy farming adaptation.
    This creates a large portability loss for any trait where
    LCT is a significant locus. -/

/-- **GxE reduces cross-population effect correlation.**
    Model: In pop1, effect of variant i is β_i.
    In pop2, effect is β_i + δ_i where δ_i is the GxE perturbation.

    Without GxE (δ = 0): cross-pop correlation of effects = 1.
    With GxE (δ ≠ 0): correlation < 1 because δ adds uncorrelated noise.

    Formally, if σ²_β is the variance of true effects and σ²_δ is the
    GxE perturbation variance (uncorrelated with β), then:
      ρ_with_gxe = σ²_β / √(σ²_β * (σ²_β + σ²_δ))
                  = √(σ²_β / (σ²_β + σ²_δ))

    Since σ²_δ > 0, the denominator exceeds the numerator. -/

    Model: Each lipid trait has the same genetic variance σ²_β
    but different GxE variance. Portability is proportional to
    the effect correlation squared:
      port ∝ σ²_β / (σ²_β + σ²_δ)

## Anthropometric Trait Portability

Height and body proportions show relatively good portability,

variants captured by GWAS.
-/

section AnthropometricTraits

/-- **Near-neutral portability for highly polygenic traits.**
    For highly polygenic traits under stabilizing selection toward
    a shared optimum, effect correlation ρ ≈ 1. The portability
    gap from neutral is determined by (1 - ρ²).

    If the per-locus selection coefficient is s and there are n loci,
    the deviation of ρ from 1 scales as O(1/n) under the infinitesimal
    model, because the per-locus selection effect on divergence is
    proportional to s/n which → 0.

    We model: ρ = 1 - δ where δ = c/n for some constant c.
    Then 1 - ρ² = 1 - (1-δ)² = 2δ - δ² < 2δ = 2c/n.

/-- **High polygenicity aids portability.**
    When a trait has many contributing loci (n_loci > n_threshold),
    no single locus dominates. Population-specific effects average out.
    By CLT, the sum of many small contributions is robust.
    Each locus contributes < 1/n_threshold of total variance.

/-- **Rank correlation is preserved under monotone transforms.**
    Spearman's ρ (rank correlation) is invariant to monotone transforms
    of the marginals. PGS portability loss acts as a noisy monotone
    transform: scores shrink toward the mean but preserve ordering
    for most individuals.

    Model: Let X be the true PGS and Y = aX + ε be the cross-population
    prediction, where a is the attenuation factor (0 < a ≤ 1) and ε is
    noise uncorrelated with X.

    Pearson r² = a²σ²_X / (a²σ²_X + σ²_ε)
    This is strictly less than 1 (information loss in R² metric).

    Under monotone-plus-noise, rank correlation ≥ Pearson r because
    rank correlation is invariant to monotone marginal transforms,
    capturing the full monotone signal that Pearson partially misses.
    Full proof requires copula theory (Kruskal 1958). -/
