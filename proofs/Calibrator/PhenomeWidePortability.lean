## Trait Classification by Portability Pattern

Traits can be classified by how their portability relates to
genetic distance. This classification reflects underlying biology.

### Derivation: Stabilizing Selection Reduces Fst at Causal Loci

Under the Wright-Fisher model, neutral allele frequency drift gives
  Fst_neutral = 1 - (1 - 1/(2*Ne))^t

where Ne is the effective population size and t is the number of generations.
The factor (1 - 1/(2*Ne))^t is the probability that two lineages have NOT
coalesced by generation t -- i.e., the fraction of heterozygosity remaining.

Under stabilizing selection with coefficient s > 0, alleles at causal loci
experience selection pressure that constrains frequency changes. The effective
drift rate is reduced: instead of losing heterozygosity at rate 1/(2*Ne) per
generation, the per-generation loss is 1/(2*Ne) - s_correction, where
s_correction > 0 captures selection maintaining polymorphism.

Concretely, define:
  neutralDriftFactor(Ne, t)      = (1 - 1/(2*Ne))^t
  selectedDriftFactor(Ne, t, s)  = (1 - 1/(2*Ne) + s_correction)^t

where 0 < s_correction < 1/(2*Ne), so the selected drift factor per
generation is strictly larger (closer to 1) than the neutral one but still at
most 1. Both halves of that range are load-bearing and both are now hypotheses
of every theorem below: the lower bound gives the strict inequality, the upper
bound is what keeps `fstFromDriftFactor` from returning a negative F_ST.

Since heterozygosity_selected = H_0 * selectedDriftFactor > H_0 * neutralDriftFactor =
heterozygosity_neutral,
and Fst = 1 - H_between / H_total = 1 - driftFactor (in the island model),
we get:

  Fst_selected = 1 - selectedDriftFactor < 1 - neutralDriftFactor = Fst_neutral

This is the formal justification for the hypothesis fst_causal < fst_neutral
used in the portability theorem below.
-/

/-- **Neutral drift factor per generation.**
    Under Wright-Fisher, the probability of NOT coalescing in one generation
    is (1 - 1/(2*Ne)), and that quantity raised to the t-th power is the
    fraction of ancestral heterozygosity remaining after t generations *in a
    closed population with no mutation*.

    Regime: closed population, no mutation. The qualifier is not decoration: the
    unqualified claim that the retained fraction *is* this power is what measurement
    rejects. Under
    mutation-drift balance heterozygosity is stationary: simulation at
    `Ne = 1000`, `t = 4000` measures the retention as `1.025 ± 0.020` where this
    formula gives `0.135`. `Calibrator.DriftRegime` exhibits the two regimes and
    proves they disagree at every positive time.

    This body is the retention of `closedPopulation`, the regime object that
    carries the falsification. `closedPopulation_het_eq_neutralDriftFactor`
    below ties the two together, so neither copy can carry an empirical status
    the other lacks.

    Empirical status: FALSIFIED at demographic equilibrium; see
    `closedPopulation`. It remains correct inside the declared regime, so the
    theorems below are conditional on that regime holding rather than false. -/
noncomputable def neutralDriftFactor (Ne : ℝ) (t : ℕ) : ℝ :=
  (1 - 1 / (2 * Ne)) ^ t

/-- **neutralDriftFactor at its junk point, named.** An empty population loses all heterozygosity
immediately. The per-generation factor is junk-one and the retention is `1` at every generation
count, so the error does not attenuate with `t` -- it is the multiplicative identity and
persists exactly. Consumers must guard the argument that makes the divisor vanish. -/
theorem neutralDriftFactor_empty_population_is_junk (t : ℕ) :
    neutralDriftFactor 0 t = 1 := by
  unfold neutralDriftFactor
  simp

/-- **This factor is the closed-population regime's retention.**

The tie is to the regime *object*, not to another copy of the formula. That
distinction is the point. A free-standing `driftRetention` used to hold the
same body in `DriftRegime`, and it was removed — correctly — as a copy of a
regime's content that could not record which regime it came from. Had this
identity been stated against that copy it would have died with it; stated
against `closedPopulation` it survives, and it makes the regime and its
falsification reachable from this file by a proof rather than by a comment. -/

    (closedPopulation Ne H₀ hH).het t = neutralDriftFactor Ne t * H₀ := by
  simp [closedPopulation, neutralDriftFactor]

/-- **Selected drift factor per generation.**
    Under stabilizing selection with correction s_correction, the
    per-generation heterozygosity retention is higher:
    (1 - 1/(2*Ne) + s_correction)^t.
    The s_correction term reflects selection maintaining polymorphism
    at causal loci, reducing the effective drift rate.

    **Admissible range.** `s_correction` must satisfy
    `0 < s_correction < 1/(2*Ne)`. The prose above this definition always said
    so; the definition and every theorem about it used to hypothesize only
    `0 < s_correction`, and above the upper bound the base exceeds `1`, the
    factor grows without bound in `t`, and `fstFromDriftFactor` returns a
    negative `F_ST` that then flows into `causalPortabilityFromLocalFst` and
    `better_than_neutral_implies_stabilizing_selection`. The bound is now in the
    hypotheses of every theorem here, and `selectedDriftFactor_mem_unit` /
    `fst_from_selectedDriftFactor_mem_unit` state the ranges so a replacement
    body that escapes them cannot typecheck.

    **`s_correction` is a free knob, not a derived quantity.** Nothing in this
    file or the corpus defines it in terms of a selection coefficient, a fitness
    function, or a stabilizing-selection model; it is a parameter whose sign and
    magnitude are assumed, and the theorems below establish only what follows
    from those assumptions. Deriving it from a stabilizing-selection model --
    which would fix its dependence on the selection strength, the number of
    loci, and `Ne` -- has not been done, and until it is, the results here are
    conditional on the assumption rather than evidence for it.

    Empirical status: UNTESTED, and NOT MEASURABLE in this form. The
    paragraph above is the reason: `s_correction` has no operational definition,
    so a simulation cannot set it without inventing one, and whatever the
    simulation then measures is a property of the invention rather than of this
    definition.

    That is not a conjecture about the difficulty. It was attempted
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk7.py`,
    `test_selected_drift_factor`) with a per-generation restoring term standing
    in for `s_correction`, and the result carries the signature of a design
    testing itself: the `s_correction = 0` cell agreed at 0.02 sems, while the
    two cells where the invented term actually bit disagreed at 9.5 and 8.1.
    The verdict gates returned LEAD rather than FALSIFIED, correctly, because no
    positive control had been declared.

    A measurement becomes possible only once the derivation the paragraph
    above says is missing is supplied -- fixing the dependence of `s_correction`
    on selection strength, locus count and `Ne`. Until then this definition is
    counted among the unmeasured, which it is, and no simulation should be built
    against it. A corpus-wide scan
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/unmeasurable_scan.py`) finds this is
    the ONLY definition still marked UNTESTED whose docstring admits its own
    parameter is unpinned, so the category is one definition rather than the
    class it first appeared to be. -/
noncomputable def selectedDriftFactor (Ne : ℝ) (t : ℕ) (s_correction : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  (1 - 1 / (2 * Ne) + s_correction) ^ t

/-- **selectedDriftFactor at its junk point, named.** The drift term `1 / (2 * Ne)` is junk-zero at
`Ne = 0`, so the factor reduces to selection alone and an empty population is reported as one in
which drift does nothing. As with `neutralDriftFactor` the error compounds with the generation
count rather than attenuating. Consumers must exclude the argument that makes the guard vanish. -/
theorem selectedDriftFactor_empty_population_is_junk (t : ℕ) (s_correction : ℝ) :
    selectedDriftFactor 0 t s_correction = (1 + s_correction) ^ t := by
  unfold selectedDriftFactor
  simp

/-- **Fst from a drift factor.**
    In the island/drift model, Fst = 1 - driftFactor, where driftFactor
    is the fraction of ancestral heterozygosity retained.

    This map returns a valid `F_ST` only for `driftFactor ∈ (0, 1]`. It has no
    clamp of its own, deliberately: the constraint belongs on the factor it is
    fed, and `fstFromDriftFactor_mem_unit` below states which inputs are
    admissible. Feeding it a factor above `1` -- which `selectedDriftFactor`
    used to permit -- returns a negative `F_ST`.

    **Inherited falsification.** This body, `1 - driftFactor`, is innocent: it
    is an involution on the unit interval and carries no regime of its own. But
    an innocent body fed a falsified input yields a falsified result, and the
    input this file supplies is `neutralDriftFactor`, which is falsified at
    demographic equilibrium. So every value computed here through that route
    inherits the closed-population, no-mutation regime, and nothing in this
    definition's signature or body records that. It is written down here because
    an inheritance of that kind is invisible otherwise: a reader checking this
    definition alone finds nothing wrong with it, which is the whole difficulty.

    Empirical status: UNTESTED.

`DriftRegime.lossOfRetention` sends a closed-population retention to the heterozygosity
lost with it. It is `1 - ·` again, so it agrees numerically with the two `F_ST` readings
above. The three readings stay separate on purpose — a within-population loss, a
between-population `F_ST`, and a retained frequency correlation are different quantities,
and `DriftRegime` records what substituting one for another cost — but the map they share
is written down here, so a convention change in any one of them contradicts this. This
module is where all three are visible at once. -/

fluctuating/diversifying selection regime.**
    A subunit observed cross-population effect correlation by itself is not yet
    a regime label. But if the same trait also has selected-architecture
    variance above the stabilizing mutation-selection baseline, then the
    observed summary is matched by a fluctuating-selection regime and by no
    stabilizing regime. For fixed drift coordinates, that same observed effect
    correlation forces the portability ratio below the neutral drift baseline. -/

/-- **GxE reduces cross-population effect correlation.**
    Model: In pop1, effect of variant i is β_i.
    In pop2, effect is β_i + δ_i where δ_i is the GxE perturbation.

    Without GxE (δ = 0): cross-pop correlation of effects = 1.
    With GxE (δ ≠ 0): correlation < 1 because δ adds uncorrelated noise.

    Formally, if σ²_β is the variance of true effects and σ²_δ is the
    GxE perturbation variance (uncorrelated with β), then:
      ρ_with_gxe = σ²_β / √(σ²_β * (σ²_β + σ²_δ))
                  = √(σ²_β / (σ²_β + σ²_δ))

    Since σ²_δ > 0, the denominator exceeds the numerator. -/

## Anthropometric Trait Portability

Height and body proportions show relatively good portability,
suggesting largely neutral genetic architecture for the common
variants captured by GWAS.

section AnthropometricTraits

/-- **`1 - (1 - c/n)² < 2c/n`.**

    Renamed from `near_neutral_portability_highly_polygenic`, which claimed a
    population-genetic result the statement does not contain. What is proved is the
    algebraic fact that expanding `1 - (1 - δ)²` leaves `2δ - δ²`, strictly below `2δ`
    whenever `δ ≠ 0`. It holds for every real `c` and every `n ≥ 2`; nothing in it is
    specific to portability, and nothing in it degrades as `n` grows.

    The former docstring supplied the missing half as prose: that under the infinitesimal
    model with a per-locus selection coefficient `s` across `n` loci, the cross-population
    effect correlation is `ρ = 1 - c/n`, so that `1 - ρ²` is the portability gap. That
    identification is the entire scientific claim and it is **assumed, not derived** —
    there is no `s` in the statement, no locus count beyond a bare `n : ℕ`, no effect
    correlation, and no derivation anywhere in this corpus fixing `ρ` to that form. The
    unused `c ≤ 1` was the only thing tying `c` to a correlation scale, and dropping it
    costs the theorem nothing, which is the measure of how little the model was doing.

    Read as an inequality it is correct and cheap. Read as "highly polygenic traits are
    near-neutrally portable" it was an unproved population-genetic assertion resting on an
    `O(1/n)` scaling argument that appears in no statement. -/
