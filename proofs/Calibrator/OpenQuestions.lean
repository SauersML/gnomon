# Formal Proofs for Open Questions in PGS Portability

Reference: Wang et al. (2026), "Three open questions in polygenic score portability",
Nature Communications 17:942.  DOI: 10.1038/s41467-026-68565-3

## The Three Open Questions

1. **Genetic distance poorly predicts individual-level accuracy.**
2. **Portability trends are trait-specific** (immune traits decay fastest).
3. **Portability depends on the prediction metric** (precision vs recall diverge).

We also formalize sub-questions:
4. Environmental variance heterogeneity confounds R² comparisons.
5. Winner's curse × allelic turnover amplification.
6. PGS variance non-monotonicity for immune traits.
7. Heterozygosity-driven predictor variance increase with distance.

## Open Question 1: Law of Total Variance and Weak Predictability

Individual-level squared prediction error ε²ᵢ has high within-group variance.
The law of total variance implies R²(ε², genetic_distance) is small whenever
the conditional variance E[Var(ε²|D)] dominates Var(E[ε²|D]).

/-! The conditional-noise-floor and Gaussian-floor bounds on the explainable fraction answer
this question, and they are `explainable_fraction_bound_of_conditional_noise_floor` and
`explainable_fraction_bound_of_conditional_gaussian_floor` in `Calibrator.TransportIdentities`.

They were also restated here, suffixed `_exact`, each copying its original's eight-line
measure-theoretic binder block and citing the original as its proof.  Both live in the
`Calibrator` namespace already, so the copies renamed nothing and reached no reader the
originals did not; what they added was a second block of hypotheses to keep in step. -/

/-- **The between-group fraction of an assumed variance decomposition is at most one.**

    Previously `law_of_total_variance_r2_bound`, documented as the law of total variance
    identity `Var(Z) = E[Var(Z|D)] + Var(E[Z|D])`. The law is not proved here: it is the
    hypothesis `h_decomp`, three unrelated reals related by an equation. What remains after
    it is assumed is that a nonnegative summand's share of a positive total is at most one,
    which is `div_le_one` plus `linarith`.

    The real conditional-variance statements in this file are
    `explainable_fraction_bound_of_conditional_noise_floor_exact` and its Gaussian
    companion, which work against `conditionalVariance` and `conditionalMean` on an actual
    measure rather than against three scalars. Those are where the law of total variance
    is genuinely used. -/
theorem between_group_variance_fraction_le_one
    (varZ eVarZgivenD varEZgivenD : ℝ)
    (h_decomp : varZ = eVarZgivenD + varEZgivenD)

  linarith

/-- **The complementary share of a two-part decomposition:** if
    `varZ = a + b` with `varZ > 0` and `a ≥ (1 - δ)·varZ`, then `b/varZ ≤ δ`.

    Read as the law of total variance, `a` is `E[Var(Z|D)]`, `b` is
    `Var(E[Z|D])`, and the conclusion is a bound on `R²(Z,D)`. That reading is
    supplied entirely by `h_decomp`, which stipulates the decomposition: there
    is no `Z`, no `D`, no conditional expectation and no `R²` below, and the
    law of total variance is not invoked, only assumed in the shape of an
    equation between three reals. A measured `δ` for a fitted model is not an
    instance of this, whose variables are free. -/

/-- **SES explains as much as genetic distance.**
    If both covariates explain comparable fractions and their total
    is bounded, each individual fraction must be small. -/

heterogeneity together with trait-specific baseline weights.

/-- **Heterozygosity increases toward 0.5.**
    Under divergent selection, allele freq p moves from extreme to
    intermediate → H = 2p(1-p) increases.
    This drives PGS variance increase for immune traits. -/

/-- **PGS variance increases when the large-effect locus gains more heterozygosity than the
small-effect locus loses.** This is the mechanism proposed for WBC/lymphocyte count.

    A statement taking `h_net : v_large_t - v_large_s > v_small_s - v_small_t` and
    concluding `v_large_s + v_small_s < v_large_t + v_small_t` would be no mechanism at all:
    those two inequalities are the *same inequality rearranged*, so the hypothesis would be
    the conclusion and the proof the rearrangement.

    This one cannot be rearranged into its own hypotheses, because the hypotheses
    are about **effect sizes and heterozygosities separately** and the conclusion is about
    the variance sum they generate. A locus at frequency `p` with effect `β` contributes
    `2β²p(1-p)` to score variance, so the claim has content precisely when the weighting by
    `β²` is doing work: the large-effect locus must actually be the larger-effect one
    (`hβ`), and its heterozygosity gain must exceed the small locus's loss
    (`hlarge_gains_more`). Neither follows from the conclusion.

    Use `two_mul_one_sub_lt_of_lt_of_le_half` to discharge the gain hypothesis from allele
    frequencies moving toward `1/2` under divergent selection, which is the biological step
    the prose describes. -/

/-- **PGS variance increase + effect decorrelation = compounded R² drop.**

    they are one inequality. `Calibrator.GeneEnvironmentInterplay.env_variance_reduces_h2` is the

    Kept under its old name because the arithmetic is what the surrounding discussion of
    omitted-variable bias appeals to, but read it as what it is: no regression, no
    estimator and no correlation appears in the statement. That the naive coefficient on
    genetic distance picks up exactly `β_ses · ρ` when SES is omitted is the standard
    omitted-variable formula, asserted in this docstring and derived nowhere in this

## Unified Portability Theory: Four-Factor Decomposition

Portability ratio = AF_factor × LD_factor × Effect_factor × Env_factor.
Genetic distance (Fst) captures only the AF factor, explaining why it

section UnifiedTheory

/-- **The four-factor product is strictly below its AF factor alone.**

    Previously `single_factor_insufficient`, "No single factor captures the full ratio".
    Insufficiency of a single factor is a claim about approximation error, or about a
    factor failing to determine the product; neither is stated. What is proved is one
    strict inequality between the product and one of its factors, which is what you get
    from the other three being below one. It supports the surrounding argument — an Fst
    proxy that sees only the AF factor overstates portability — without being that
    argument. -/

    bounded by the AF variance fraction". No R², no genetic distance and no portability
    appears in the statement, and no bound *by* the AF fraction is proved — what is proved
    is a bound *on* it, namely that it is under one, which holds of any of the four
    fractions and is `div_lt_one`. The variance-decomposition reading, in which these four

/-- **An effect-retention factor `ρ² < 1` strictly lowers target R² at a fixed target Fst.**

    Previously `drift_only_overestimates_immune_portability`, documented as "Under pure
    drift, portability ratio = (1-Fst_T)/(1-Fst_S). This is what Fst predicts." No ratio of
    source to target appears in the conclusion: **both sides are evaluated at `fstT`**, and
    the comparison is between including the turnover factor `ρ²` and omitting it. The
    source Fst enters no term.

    The linter caught it. The hypotheses `0 ≤ fstS` and `fstS < fstT` — the ones that made
    the statement look like a source-versus-target comparison — occurred in no proof term,
    and `fstS` itself occurred nowhere else, so all three are gone from the signature. What
    the theorem says is that a drift-only prediction, which omits `ρ²`, is higher than one
    that includes it; that supports the surrounding claim about immune traits without being
    a statement about genetic distance at all. -/

## LD Decay Interaction with Allelic Turnover

The paper shows that for immune traits, both LD patterns AND allelic effects
change simultaneously. The combined effect is worse than either alone.
We formalize this multiplicative interaction.

/-- **LD tagging efficiency decays exponentially with genetic distance.**
    ρ²_LD(d) = exp(-λ_LD · d).

    **Attribution, corrected: this is NOT the Ohta-Kimura result**, which the
    docstring previously claimed. Ohta and Kimura (1971) give
    `σ_d² ≈ (10 + ρ)/((2 + ρ)(11 + ρ))` with `ρ = 4·Nₑ·c`, formalized at
    `LDDecayTheory.ohtaKimuraSigmaDSq`; that is HYPERBOLIC in the scaled
    recombination rate, not exponential in it, and so is Sved's
    `r² ≈ 1/(1 + 4·Nₑ·c)`. No published neutral two-locus theory in this
    corpus's reference set predicts an exponential in genetic distance. The
    exponential here is a phenomenological one-parameter chart, and it is only
    that.

    Regime: `d` is genetic distance, `λ_LD` a fitted rate with no derivation.
    Nothing identifies `λ_LD` with `Nₑ` or with a recombination rate, so this
    body cannot be inverted for a demographic parameter.

    Empirical status: **FALSIFIED as a shape**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/popgensel/ldshapecell.py`, cell I). This
    supersedes the LEAD the sibling body `PortabilityDrift.ldCorrelationDecay`
    carried -- the same exponential chart, fitted against the same kind of
    simulated `r²` curve, missing at BOTH ends at 21.7 and 14.2 sems. That run
    was recorded as a lead rather than a verdict for one reason: it carried no
    valid positive control. Cell I supplies exactly that control and changes
    nothing else.

    Both shapes are fitted to the SAME binned msprime `r²` values with a free
    amplitude AND a free rate each, so neither is handicapped and any upward
    bias in the `r²` estimator is common to both. The discrimination is the
    shape, which no estimator convention moves.

    | design | exponential χ²/point | hyperbolic χ²/point | worst exp. residual | worst hyp. |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | `Nₑ = 2000`, 4 Mb | 28.49 | 4.16 | 8.87 sems | 3.91 sems |
    | `Nₑ = 5000`, 2 Mb | 79.66 | 1.95 | 12.56 sems | 3.46 sems |

    **The positive control, which is the whole point of this cell.** A fitter
    that prefers the hyperbolic on real data proves nothing unless it prefers the
    EXPONENTIAL on data that is genuinely exponential. Run on a true exponential
    with the same `x` grid and matched per-point noise, the same fitter prefers
    the exponential by a sum-of-squares ratio of 168 and 197. So the preference
    reported above is the data's and not the fitter's, and the lead becomes a
    verdict.

    This does not identify the hyperbolic's fitted rate with `4·Nₑ`: at
    `Nₑ = 5000` the fit returns `b = 6572` against Sved's `20000`. What is
    established is that the decay is hyperbolic in genetic distance and not
    exponential in it, which is what this body gets wrong -- and, as the
    paragraph above already says, no choice of `λ_LD` repairs a two-sided
    failure. -/

Two theorems were deleted from this section rather than renamed.

`prevalence_dominates_sensitivity_for_recall` assumed
`sens₁ / sens₂ < n_cases₂ / n_cases₁` and concluded `n_cases₁ * sens₁ < n_cases₂ * sens₂`.
Those are the same inequality: the proof was `rwa [div_lt_div_iff₀ ...] at h_sens_ratio`,
cross-multiplication and nothing else. The docstring said "The net effect on recall depends
on whether the prevalence increase dominates the sensitivity decrease. We prove the
sufficient condition" — but the sufficient condition *is* the conclusion, restated as a
ratio, so proving it from itself decides nothing about which effect dominates. Four of its
eight hypotheses, including the one saying the target has more cases, were unused.

`different_diseases_different_portability_patterns` took four inequalities as hypotheses
and returned their conjunction, `⟨⟨h₁, h₂⟩, ⟨h₃, h₄⟩⟩`. Conjunction-introduction over
one's own premises is the case the corpus proof policy names explicitly. Nothing about
asthma, T2D, or a prevalence-distance relationship enters; the statement is true of any
four numbers with those orderings, which is what "qualitatively different patterns" was
being read off from.

The genuine metric-divergence result for this section is
`precision_recall_divergence_exists` above, which exhibits explicit witnesses satisfying
the precision identity rather than assuming the divergence.

## Calibrated PGS: When Portability is Recoverable

Not all portability loss is irrecoverable. Some can be addressed by:
1. Re-calibration (adjusting intercept and slope)
2. Ancestry-specific spline adjustments
3. Multi-ancestry training

We formalize which components of portability loss are recoverable.

    The nonvanishing hypothesis is real content: no rescaling recovers a slope that has
    been multiplied by zero. Read the name narrowly all the same. This is not
    recoverability by re-calibration, because recovering the slope requires knowing `r`,
    which this statement supplies to itself. -/

    Previously `effect_turnover_requires_target_data`, "the source GWAS provides no

    needs an information measure and a claim about what data determines what; neither
    appears. The statement is cancellation in a field: if `β_source ≠ β_target` then
    `β_source · y ≠ β_target · y` unless `y = 0`.

    This does say something the section wants — the discrepancy does not vanish, so no
    amount of rescaling the *genotype* hides it — and unlike
    `mulVec_smul_ne_of_not_aligned` above, which quantifies over all linear
    recalibrations `α` and shows none succeeds, it never quantifies over corrections at
    all. That is the difference between the two, and it is why only one of them keeps a
