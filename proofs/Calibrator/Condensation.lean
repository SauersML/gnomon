# Condensation: the multiplicative obstruction to Gaussian universality of chaos

This file formalizes closed numerical pieces of the proposed condensation geometry.
The general tangency theorem is not exported because its former interface supplied the
Legendre-transform conclusions as structure fields instead of proving them.

## Why this belongs in a polygenic-score development

A polygenic score is a normalized aggregate of many small per-variant contributions.
Every asymptotic statement about the score distribution — the Gaussian score
assumption underlying `Calibrator.ScoreDistribution`, liability-threshold
calibration, the Berry-Esseen certificates in `Calibrator.Probability` — is an
instance of the following claim: *a low-influence aggregate of genotypes behaves as
if the genotypes were Gaussian.* For **degree-one** (purely additive) scores this is
true and quantitative (Berry-Esseen). The condensation geometry PROPOSES that it
becomes false for aggregates of diverging multiplicative degree, i.e. for epistatic
scores, and locates the degree at which it fails.

**THAT PROPOSAL IS NOT PROVED IN THIS FILE.** What is formalized here is the closed
constant/window algebra, as the opening line and the attribution block below both say.

What the fifteen theorems below establish, exhaustively:
* numeric bounds and positivity for `condensationConstant = 2 - gamma - log 2` and
  for `gaussianJetVariance = pi ^ 2 / 2 - 4`, from mathlib's Euler-Mascheroni and
  `log 2` brackets -- real results, and the reason this file exists;
* elementary properties of `Phi` (monotone, into `[0,1]`) and of
  `windowVariance = Phi (w / sqrt v)` built from them;
* `criticalDegree N c = log N / c` as a DEFINITION, with `subcritical_iff` and
  `supercritical_iff` relating it to `c * m` -- these are `lt_div_iff₀` and
  `div_lt_iff₀`, i.e. arithmetic, not a phase transition.

NOT ONE THEOREM HERE MENTIONS CHAOS, UNIVERSALITY, OR A LIMIT LAW. `criticalDegree`
is a name given to `log N / c`; that the quantity so named is the boundary of a real
phase transition is the BBM result cited below, not something proved here. The name
carries the physics and the proof carries the arithmetic, and the two must not be
read as one.

What the arithmetic does deliver, and it is a study-design statement rather than a
limit theorem: `subcritical_iff_exp_lt` puts the boundary in panel units, as
`exp (c * m) < N`, and `two_pow_le_gaussian_panel_requirement` shows that requirement
exceeds `2 ^ m` at the Gaussian coupling because `log 2 < condensationConstant`. So
admissible interaction degree grows like the logarithm of the panel, and each further
unit of degree more than doubles the panel needed. That consequence is unconditional
on the transition: it is what the definition costs, whatever the definition turns out
to mark.

The failure is not additive and is therefore invisible to every additive diagnostic
(cumulants, influences, mixing). It is multiplicative: a product of `m` independent
standardized factors converts the *diagonal* data of the coordinate law into an
exponential separation of scale. The controlling object is the Mellin exponent
`psi(theta) = log E |x| ^ (2 * theta)` at the interior point `theta = 1` — the
size-bias point — not the jet of the log-characteristic function at the origin, which
is what cumulants are.

## Attribution (recorded before any novelty claim, per the standing rule)

The phase-transition mechanism for `sum_j exp(t X_j)` with `N ~ exp(lambda H(t))`
terms, its two critical points, and limit laws at the critical points, are
Ben Arous-Bogachev-Molchanov, *Limit theorems for sums of random exponentials*,
PTRF **132** (2005). The parallel fluctuation phase diagram for the REM is
Bovier-Kurkova-Loewe, Ann. Probab. **30** (2002). Nearly optimal upper *and lower*
bounds for Gaussian universality of approximately polynomial functions are
Huang-Austern-Orbanz, arXiv:2403.10711; the condensation counterexample lives in
their lower-bound territory. `condensationConstant` below is an **evaluation** of the
BBM second critical point for `log g ^ 2` increments, not a new constant. What is
formalized here is the closed Gaussian constant/window algebra and its direct genetics
specializations. The proposed completeness-of-blindness theorem is not exported.

## Main results in this file

* `condensationConstant` (`c_G = 2 - gamma - log 2`) with rigorous two-sided bounds
  and strict positivity, from mathlib's Euler-Mascheroni and `log 2` bounds.
* `gaussianJetVariance` (`v_G = pi ^ 2 / 2 - 4`) with strict positivity.
* `criticalDegree` and `subcritical_iff` — the algebraic boundary `m* = log N / c`.
  `subcritical_iff` is the division rearrangement `m < log N / c ↔ c * m < log N` and
  nothing more; that this boundary is *sharp* — that the limit laws differ across it —
  is the BBM/BKL analysis, which is not formalized here.
* `windowVariance` and its monotonicity/limits — the condensation-window law
  `N(0, Phi(w / sqrt v))`, whose variance interpolates `0 -> 1` through the error
  function of the window position.

## 1. The Mellin profile and the Tangency Lemma

No `MellinProfile` interface is exported. The defining properties of a Legendre
transform — tangency, uniqueness, positive jet variance — are analytic facts that must be
proved from an actual law and an actual transform, not accepted as structure fields.

## 2. The condensation constant

For a standard Gaussian `g`, the size-biased law of `g ^ 2` (density proportional to
`x` times the chi-square-one density) is a chi-square with **three** degrees of
freedom, whose log-mean is `digamma(3/2) + log 2 = 2 - gamma - log 2`. That number is
the drift of the size-biased multiplicative walk, and — in the BBM phase diagram
cited above, NOT by anything proved in this file — the reciprocal slope of the
condensation phase boundary. No tangency geometry in this file supplies that step; it is
cited from BBM and nothing here discharges it.

/-- **A sharper lower bound: `log 2 < c_G`.**

`condensationConstant_bounds` is too coarse for one downstream question. Its bracket
`(0.640, 0.807)` *straddles* `log 2 = 0.69315`, so it cannot decide whether the
condensation constant exceeds `log 2` — and that comparison is exactly what separates a
balanced hard-called genotype locus from its Gaussian surrogate, since
`Calibrator.PolygenicSpectroscopy.hweMellinDrift_half` gives `c(1/2) = log 2`. The claim
was asserted in prose there while being underivable from anything in the development.

The gap is closed by taking more terms. Mathlib's `eulerMascheroniConstant_lt_two_thirds`
is `eulerMascheroniSeq' 6`, but `eulerMascheroniConstant_lt_eulerMascheroniSeq'` holds at
*every* index, and the sequence `H_n - log n` decreases to `gamma`. At `n = 16`,

  `gamma < H_16 - log 16 = 2436559 / 720720 - 4 log 2`,

which gives `c_G > 2 - H_16 + 3 log 2 > 0.69871`, clearing `log 2 < 0.69315` with a
margin of about `0.0056`. Index `16` is chosen because it is the smallest power of two
that clears the comparison, so `log 16` collapses to `4 log 2` and mathlib's tight
rational bounds on `log 2` are the only numeric input needed. -/

## 3. The sharp phase boundary

With `N` disjoint monomials of common degree `m`, the design is subcritical (the
Lindeberg condition holds, both sides converge to `N(0,1)`, universality holds) when
`c * m < log N`, and supercritical (the Gaussian side condenses to the point mass at
zero while a lattice-modulus law such as Rademacher stays Gaussian) when
`c * m > log N`. The boundary is `m* = log N / c`, i.e. `1.37035... * log N` for the
Gaussian.
-/

/-- The critical degree `m* = log N / c`. Below it, chaos is Lindeberg-democratic;
above it, the variance is carried by values too large ever to be witnessed among `N`
samples and the observed sum is empty. -/
noncomputable def criticalDegree (N c : ℝ) : ℝ := Real.log N / c

/-- **criticalDegree at zero c, named.** A zero coupling constant admits no condensation and the

/-- **Subcriticality in panel units: the panel must exceed `exp (c * m)`.**

`subcritical_iff` states the boundary additively, as `c * m < log N`.  Exponentiating
puts it in the units a study is actually designed in, and the shape of the requirement
becomes visible: the admissible interaction degree grows like the LOGARITHM of the
panel, so the panel needed for a given degree grows exponentially in that degree.

This is arithmetic about the defined quantity `criticalDegree`, exactly as
`subcritical_iff` is.  That the quantity so named is where a real transition occurs is
the cited BBM result and is not proved here; what is proved is what the definition
costs in sample size. -/

/-- **Each unit of interaction degree more than doubles the panel required.**

At the Gaussian coupling the panel must exceed `exp (condensationConstant * m)`, and
`log 2 < condensationConstant` (`log_two_lt_condensationConstant`), so that requirement
is at least `2 ^ m`.

For a polygenic score this is the design statement behind the arc.  A purely additive
score is degree one and costs nothing here.  Admitting interactions of multiplicative
degree `m` — pairwise is `m = 2`, three-way is `m = 3` — requires a panel exponential in
`m` before the aggregate is even in the regime where a Gaussian score assumption could
hold.  Degree, not variant count, is what the panel has to outrun. -/

## 4. The condensation-window law

At the critical window `log N = c * m + w * sqrt m` the variance of the chaos is
partitioned by the Gaussian fluctuation of the size-biased multiplicative walk into a
*retained* fraction `Phi(w / sqrt v)` and an *escaped* fraction `1 - Phi(w / sqrt v)`.
The escaped fraction leaves no trace: no jumps, no heavy tail, just missing variance.
The limit law is `N(0, Phi(w / sqrt v))`.

Status: presented, per the attribution ledger, as at best a boundary-window
refinement inside the BBM/BKL framework, pending a line-by-line comparison with BBM's
critical-point CLT. The statements proved here are the elementary structural ones:
the retained fraction is a probability, is strictly increasing in the window position,
and interpolates `0 -> 1`.

## 5. What the condensation theorems say about a polygenic score

Recorded here as a docstring rather than as a theorem, because the genetics content
is formalized in `Calibrator.PolygenicSpectroscopy`; this is the bridge sentence.

Let a score aggregate `N` disjoint epistatic terms, each a product of `m` standardized
genotypes. Influence per variant is `1 / N`, so the score is as polygenic as one could
ask. The BBM/BKL phase picture predicts a transition at `m = (1 / c) * log N`, below
which the true and surrogate score laws agree and above which they do not.

**None of that is a theorem of this file.** What is proved above is the constant
algebra (`condensationConstant_bounds`, `gaussianJetVariance_pos`), the division
rearrangement `subcritical_iff`, and the elementary properties of `windowVariance`.
The limit laws on either side of the boundary are the analysis of Ben Arous-Bogachev-
Molchanov, not formalized here, and the direction of the effect — which side condenses
first — has been *measured to be the reverse of the obvious reading* in two of the
regimes tested; see the MEASURED block on
`Calibrator.PolygenicSpectroscopy.maxSafeEpistaticOrder`.

`c` here is the *genotype* drift `E[x ^ 2 log x ^ 2]`, computed in closed form as a
function of allele frequency in `Calibrator.PolygenicSpectroscopy`. It is **not**
`c_G`, and it diverges as the allele frequency goes to zero. So the degree at which
the Gaussian surrogate fails is allele-frequency dependent, and fails soonest for rare
variants. -/
