/-! `r2FromSignalVariance` and the Gaussian-AUC declarations live in
`Calibrator.TransportedMetrics` (DGP.lean). `Calibrator.DGP` is imported, so
the module is available, but the namespace was never opened here and this file
refers to five of its declarations WITHOUT qualification. Lean does not report
that as a missing constant: it auto-binds the bare name as an implicit
variable, which is why the failure surfaced as three unrelated-looking symptoms
-- "unknown identifier", "function expected at", and the discriminating
"LOCAL VARIABLE `r2FromSignalVariance` has no definition". A definition that
had failed to build would say something else, and `Calibrator.DGP` itself
builds clean.

These five names are opened rather than qualified at ~40 call sites: the
mechanical repoint is the larger and riskier diff, and an explicit import list
cannot collide, since this file defines none of these names and the only
`Profile` and `calibratedBrier` in the corpus are the ones inside this same
namespace. The remaining `TransportedMetrics.` prefixes in this file are left
alone; both spellings resolve to the same constant. -/

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk1.py`,
    `test_coalescent_hazard`). A two-epoch coalescent, `Ne = 500` until
    generation 800 and `Ne = 3000` after, so the pairwise hazard `1/(2 Ne(t))`
    is piecewise constant and its integral is exact. 60000 independent
    genealogies, survival read as the fraction with `T_MRCA > t`:

      t        this def   simulated            sems

    The design crosses the epoch boundary, so a formula that integrated the
    hazard with the wrong size on either side would show up; the `t = 1500` and
    `t = 3000` rows are the ones that test the second epoch.

    The divisor is what a simulation can decide, so the body is read through the
    saturation law it is paired with and inverted: `F_ST / (1 - F_ST)` estimates
    `τ` directly, and `t / Nₑ` or `t / (4·Nₑ)` would miss it by exactly the
    factor in the divisor. Across `Nₑ` and `t` chosen so `τ` runs 0.125, 0.25,
    1, 2, 4 -- a thirtytwofold sweep, prediction spanning 97% -- the measured
    odds are 0.2477 ± 0.0080, 1.0038 ± 0.0309, 0.1326 ± 0.0034, 1.9946 ±
    0.0559 and 4.0164 ± 0.0799, worst cell 2.24 sems. `Nₑ` and `t` are moved

/-- **`F_ST` after a clean split, in coalescent units.**

This is not an independent formula.  It is `coalFst` expressed in units of
`tau = t / (2 Ne)`, and `coalFst_eq_fstFromTau` is the theorem that says so; the
two cannot drift apart without that theorem failing.  The previous body here was
`1 - exp (-tau)`, which is the coalescence CDF already defined in this file as
`coalescenceCdfFromHazard` under unit hazard -- the probability that a lineage
pair has coalesced by `tau`, not the between-population variance ratio.  The two
were conflated, and `fstFromTau_lt_coalescenceCdf` now records that they are
never equal.

    Regime: instantaneous clean split, constant equal daughter sizes, no
    migration, no selection, continuous (large-N) coalescent -- the model under
    which `validation/differential/refs.py`'s `split_fst_hudson` is exact.  The
    regime is the whole point of this definition rather than a caveat on it: the
    closed-population drift recurrence is a *different* model, not the `F_ST` of
    a split, and confusing the two is the model error that the
    `heterozygosityLossDerived`/`fstFromTau`/`targetHetFromFst` cluster turns on (see the
    `heterozygosityLossDerived-is-not-split-fst` check).  Outside a clean split -- under
    migration, unequal sizes, or ongoing gene flow -- this map is not claimed.

    Empirical status: VALIDATED (0.0909/0.2000/0.3333/0.5000/0.6667/0.8000 at

    0.8028, within simulation error at every point).

    Power: the prediction spans `0.0909` to `0.8000` across that `tau` grid,
    nearly an order of magnitude and most of the range `F_ST` can occupy. A
    fortyfold sweep of `tau` moves the prediction across the whole saturating
    curve, so a form that is linear in `tau`, or one saturating at a different
    rate, separates from this one on the grid rather than only at its ends. -/

/-- **fstFromTau at `tau = -1`, named.** A coalescent time of minus one is outside the admissible
range, which is exactly why it must be excluded by hypothesis rather than left to the totality
convention: the saturation curve's divisor vanishes there and Lean returns `0`, an ordinary `Fst`
value that no downstream range check will reject. Consumers must exclude it by hypothesis. -/

    convention every `F_ST` in this corpus is written for.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED** (`simcov/battery_bulk20.py`, `group_a`).
    The composition, not either half alone, is what is measured: `τ` is never
    read off, only `t` and `Nₑ` go in. Over `τ` = 0.125, 0.25, 1, 2, 4 the body

    and 0.80065 ± 0.00317, worst cell 2.26 sems at 5.1% relative. Power: the
    prediction spans 86% of the unit interval and crosses the whole saturating
    curve, so a form linear in `τ`, or one saturating at another rate, separates
    on the grid rather than only at its ends. Simulated with recombination
    (8 Mb at 1e-8): at zero recombination one genealogy per replicate makes the
    error bar honest but far too wide to decide anything. -/

/-- **Circulation inflates transfer time by the same saturation law that drift
uses for `F_ST`.**

`CirculationDefect.transferTimeInflation` is `1 + (a/s)^2`, the factor by which
circulation stretches the frontier time. Its reciprocal -- the fraction of the
frontier time that survives -- is `1 - fstFromTau ((a/s)^2)`, the complement of
the chart this file uses for drift at coalescent time `tau`.

The two modules are about different processes, and that is why the shared
functional form is worth recording rather than assuming: `x / (1 + x)` appears
in both, so a change to either body that breaks the identity fails to compile
instead of leaving the two quietly disagreeing about a shape they both use. No
hypothesis is needed, because `1 + (a/s)^2` is positive for every `s` and `a`,
including `s = 0`. -/

/-- **Branchwise-to-pairwise `F_ST` map under independent drift from a common
ancestor.**

    Regime: small divergence, `F_ST` below about `0.05`. Multiplicative
    composition is the right shape -- additive composition `fstS + fstT` is 53%
    high at `T = 4000` -- and this map is within simulation error at the shortest
    branch tested, but it degrades monotonically as divergence grows, and the
    degradation is one-sided, always too high:

    Twelve to eighteen standard errors on the last two rows. Not an estimator
    artifact: under Nei's estimator the same rows give -1.4%, +3.3%, +10.0%,
    +14.2%.

    The mechanism is derivable rather than empirical, and
    `pairwiseFstFromBranches_eq_fstFromTau_add_mul` states it: composing
    multiplicatively in `F_ST` is the same as composing *additively in coalescent
    time* after inserting a spurious `tauS * tauT` of extra divergence time.
    Coalescence times add along a path; `F_ST` values do not. At `tau` near `1`,
    which is where `T = 4000` sits, that spurious term doubles the divergence
    time, which is the sign and the size of the error above.
    `pairwiseFstFromBranchTaus` is the same composition without it.

    Empirical status: CONDITIONALLY VALID. -/
noncomputable def pairwiseFstFromBranches (fstS fstT : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  1 - (1 - fstS) * (1 - fstT)

/-- **Pairwise `F_ST` composed in coalescent time instead of in `F_ST`.**

    Under the coalescent, two demes that split `tauS` and `tauT` ago from a
    common ancestor have `E[T_between] = 1 + tauS + tauT` in units where
    `E[T_within] = 1`, because expected coalescence times add along the path.
    Hudson's ratio then gives `fstFromTau (tauS + tauT)` directly.

    This is offered as a candidate for `pairwiseFstFromBranches`, not
    substituted for it: recomputed against the four rows tabulated on that
    definition it errs -5.4%, -1.2%, +3.4%, +2.4% where the multiplicative map
    errs +0.6%, +7.0%, +13.0%, +14.7%.

    Empirical status: **FALSIFIED**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_fix.py`, `test_fst_composition`).
    Measured against msprime coalescent simulation of a clean split, recombining
    at `1e-8` so that each replicate carries many independent genealogies,
    Hudson's `F_ST` as a ratio of averages, 25 replicates of 20 Mb, 50 diploids
    per deme:

      Ne     t       this def   `coalFst`   simulated   sems off (this def)
      1000   500       0.3333      0.2000      0.19923            59.1

    On the SAME runs `coalFst` matches to 0.34, 0.25 and 0.08 sems. Two
    definitions of one quantity disagree and the simulation says which.

    The premise stated above is where it goes wrong: two demes that split `t`
    generations ago have `E[T_between] = 1 + tau`, NOT `1 + tauS + tauT`.
    Coalescence times add along a path, but the path to the common ancestor is
    traversed ONCE -- reaching the ancestral population takes `t` generations,
    not `t` from each side. Summing both branch taus double-counts the split
    time, which is exactly the observed `+50` percent.

    **The body has been corrected to the MEAN of the branch taus**, which is the
    composition with the split time counted once. On a symmetric split it
    reduces to `fstFromTau tau`, hence to `coalFst`, which is what makes the two
    definitions agree instead of differing by fifty percent. Re-measured on the
    same engine (`battery_correct.py`, `correct_pairwise_tau`, 30 replicates of
    20 Mb, recombining):

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED for equal branch lengths** (worst 1.5 sems
    over four designs spanning 0.19682 to 0.49999), and **still wrong for

    signature limitation and not a repairable constant: with unequal daughter
    sizes the between-deme coalescence also depends on the ANCESTRAL size, and
    two branch taus cannot carry it. Use `hudsonFstFromCoalescenceTimes` there.

    Power: the prediction spans 0.20000 to 0.50000 across the symmetric designs,
    a factor of two and a half, and the superseded sum form is excluded at 40 to

/-- **The gap between the two compositions is FIRST order in the branch length.**

    This theorem previously claimed the gap was bounded by `eps ^ 2`, and that
    claim was an artifact of the superseded body. It was true of
    `fstFromTau (tauS + tauT)`, whose extra `tauS * tauT` really is second
    order -- and it was the licence under which the two compositions could be
    treated as interchangeable at small `F_ST`. With the split time counted once
    rather than twice, they differ at first order and no longer may be.

    At equal branches the gap is exactly `a / (1 + a) ^ 2`, which is `a` to
    leading order. So the multiplicative composition in `F_ST` and the additive
    composition in coalescent time are two different quantities, and the
    simulation in the docstring above says the coalescent one is the measured
    `F_ST`: `0.49999 ± 0.00302` against this definition's `0.50000` where

    This body claims that the GENEALOGICAL quantity computes the FREQUENCY one,
    so the two sides are taken from two engines that share no code: `ETss` and
    `ETst` come from branch-mode diversity and divergence over the tree

    Hudson estimator over mutations dropped on that same tree, as a ratio of

/-- **First-step analysis of the structured coalescent, same-deme state.**

Symmetric two-deme island model with scaled migration `M`.  Time is in units of
`2 Nₑ` generations, so two lineages sitting in one deme coalesce at rate `1`
and each lineage leaves its deme at rate `M/2`.  From the same-deme state the
competing clocks give a total rate `1 + M`, an expected waiting time
`1/(1 + M)`, and then coalescence with probability `1/(1 + M)` or -- with
probability `M/(1 + M)` -- a migration that leaves the lineages in different
demes.  The map below sends a candidate pair of expected coalescence times to
the pair implied by one such step.

Composition convention: this is the *continuous-time* structured coalescent, in
which competing exponential clocks make the within-generation ordering of
migration and coalescence immaterial.  The discrete-generation model with a
fixed ordering has a different fixed point, differing at O(1/Nₑ).

## The closed-population, no-mutation regime, made into an object

Everything below that decays heterozygosity geometrically assumes a **closed
population with no mutation**, and it is carried as an explicit regime object below
rather than inside definition bodies, where nothing can contradict it. Simulation at
demographic equilibrium
with `Ne = 1000` measures the retention `het_A / het_anc` as

       T = 200    1.010 ± 0.022    drift-only prediction 0.905
       T = 1000   0.989 ± 0.022    drift-only prediction 0.607
       T = 4000   1.025 ± 0.020    drift-only prediction 0.135

so at `T = 4000` the recurrence predicts an 86 percent loss of heterozygosity
and the population loses none: mutation replenishes diversity as fast as drift
removes it. The cluster's `F_ST` is therefore near `0` exactly where the
measurable between-population `F_ST` is `0.50`. These are not two calibrations of
one quantity; they are different quantities sharing a name, which is why the same
error was reproduced independently several times.

This section makes the assumption an object rather than a habit.
`hetStepWithMutation` is the recurrence *with* mutation; the closed-population
recurrence is its `mu = 0` case (`hetTrajectory_of_no_mutation`);
`hetMutationFloor` is the heterozygosity that the mutation term holds a
population above forever *once it is above it*
(`hetTrajectory_ge_hetMutationFloor_of_init_ge_floor`); and
`driftOnly_lt_hetTrajectory_of_below_floor` is the quantitative cost -- once the
drift-only prediction dips below that floor it is strictly wrong, with no appeal
to simulation. `ClosedPopulationNoMutation` carries the assumption in a field, so
a use site has to discharge it instead of inheriting it silently.

`Calibrator.DriftRegime` states the epistemic half of the same incident: why
every cross-check inside the cluster passed.
-/

section ClosedPopulationRegime

/-- **One generation of the heterozygosity recurrence, with mutation.**

Drift removes a fraction `1/(2 Nₑ)` of the standing heterozygosity, and
mutation converts a fraction `2 mu` of the identical pairs -- one chance per
lineage -- back into non-identical ones. Dropping the second term is the
closed-population assumption, and it is dropped nowhere in this definition.

Composition convention: drift and mutation are applied to the same input state
and added, which is the first-order model. The unlinearised infinite-alleles
recursion multiplies `(1 - mu)²` against the drift factor and differs at
`O(mu², mu/Nₑ)`.

    Regime: none. This is the general recurrence; the closed population is the
    special case `mu = 0`, recorded by `hetTrajectory_of_no_mutation`.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**, with a stated bias
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_max.py`,
    `test_het_recurrences`). One Wright-Fisher generation with two-way allele
    mutation `p' = p(1-mu) + (1-p)mu`, 4000 loci, 400 replicates, predicted from
    the measured `H` of the preceding generation:

      Ne      mu      this def   simulated            sems    relative
      100    1e-3      0.36462   0.36391±0.00010      6.82      +0.20%
      500    1e-3      0.39493   0.39414±0.00008     10.09      +0.20%
      100    5e-3      0.40047   0.39650±0.00008     47.66      +1.00%

    High in every cell and growing with `mu`: the recursion drops the
    `mu/(2 Ne)` and `mu^2` cross terms, so it is a linearisation and not an
    identity. One percent at `mu = 5e-3` is small for a per-generation step and
    compounds over a run. 
    **Re-measured on the correct oracle**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk15.py`). The status above was
    earned against a BIALLELIC Wright-Fisher, whose exact input term is
    `2 mu (1 - 2 H)` rather than the `2 mu (1 - H)` this body carries: under
    biallelic two-way mutation `p - 1/2` contracts by `1 - 2 mu` and
    `H = 1/2 - 2 (p - 1/2)^2`. The `2 mu (1 - H)` form is the infinite-alleles
    one. The discrepancy is `2 mu H`, O(mu) per step, so it hides under the noise
    of a SINGLE generation, which is exactly what a one-step design measures --
    the error was found only by iterating the same map fifteen times, where it
    reached 632 sems.

    Re-run on infinite-alleles trajectories, this body holds at worst 0.71 sems
    over nine cells spanning `theta` 0.80 to 1.00 and `Ne` 50 to 200. The status
    stands, but it now stands on an oracle that matches the model the body
    describes, rather than on one that agreed with it to first order in `mu`.

`theta / (1 + theta)` with `theta = 4 Nₑ mu`: the level at which mutational
input balances drift loss. Below it the recurrence gains heterozygosity, above
it the recurrence loses heterozygosity, and it is never crossed from above.
This is the number the closed-population model sets to zero.

    Regime: none. Its `mu = 0` value is `0`, which is the closed-population
    assumption itself, and is why that model predicts unbounded loss.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED** (`simcov/battery_bulk20b.py`). The
    saturation is an INFINITE-ALLELES statement, and reading it under infinite
    sites is what an earlier attempt got wrong: per-site heterozygosity there is
    approximately `θ` and the `1 / (1 + θ)` denominator never shows. Measured on
    a single locus under `msprime`'s `InfiniteAlleles` model at `Nₑ = 1000` with
    100 sampled chromosomes and 40 independent replicates, with heterozygosity
    taken as the unbiased `1 - ∑ pᵢ²` over the WHOLE sample -- never conditioned
    on the locus being polymorphic, which inflates it exactly where `θ` is
    small. Over `θ` = 0.1, 0.5, 1, 3, 10 the body predicts 0.09091, 0.33333,
    0.50000, 0.75000 and 0.90909 against measured 0.11943 ± 0.02958, 0.37403 ±
    0.03421, 0.49994 ± 0.03388, 0.76355 ± 0.01782 and 0.91824 ± 0.00421, worst
    cell 2.17 sems at 1.0% relative, over a prediction spanning 90%.

    Control: Ewens' sampling formula for the expected number of distinct
    alleles, `∑ᵢ θ/(θ+i-1)`, evaluated on the same samples. It shares no algebra
    with the body and passed at worst 1.10 sems (1.50/1.53, 3.28/3.45,
    5.19/5.38, 11.12/11.40, 24.44/25.05). It earned its place: on the first run
    the control returned exactly 2 alleles in every cell, which the sampling
    formula cannot produce, and it voided a design whose heterozygosity cells
    would otherwise have been read as a 21-sem falsification of this body.

    The observation the body explains is measured too: at demographic
    equilibrium the retention stays at `1.025 ± 0.020` out to `T = 4000` where
    the floorless model predicts `0.135`.

    INDEPENDENTLY CONFIRMED, and with the competitor gate the run above lacks
    (`simcov/battery_ia02.py`). 200 replicates rather than 40, same regime, and
    two competing readings carried on the same cells: `θ/(1+2θ)` misses by up to
    182 sems and `2θ/(1+2θ)` by 18, while the body sits at worst 0.68 sems. The
    Ewens control tracks `E[K]` from 1.5 to 24.4 alleles across the hundredfold
    sweep at 0.09 to 1.45 sems. A validation with no rejected competitor is
    arithmetic; this one is not.

    THE SAME TRAP HAS NOW BITTEN THIS DEFINITION THREE TIMES, in three
    directions, and it is worth naming so it stops. `msprime.InfiniteAlleles()`

    lands at its own real-valued position, so one locus carrying `k` mutations
    is reported as `k` biallelic SITES instead of one site with `k+1` allelic
    states -- and a design reading the FIRST variant then sees two alleles
    however large `θ` is. That produced a 21-sem falsification once, a VOID in
    `battery_bulk20.py` `group_b` once, and correct numbers only when
    `sequence_length = 1` is used with msprime's default discrete genome. The

Any quantity computed from the geometric retention `(1 - 1/(2 Nₑ))^t` is a
quantity about a population in this regime and about no other. Making the regime
a structure puts the assumption in the type: `mutation_negligible` is the
dimensionless condition, and it is stated against the floor that the recurrence
actually has, not against a rate. If a caller cannot supply it, the
closed-population answer is not available to them -- which is the whole point,
since the falsified uses were all callers who could not have supplied it. -/

/-- PGS variance from the additive model under HWE.
Under an additive genetic model with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium,
PGS variance = Σᵢ βᵢ² × 2pᵢ(1-pᵢ), i.e. the sum of squared effect sizes
weighted by per-locus heterozygosity. Here `β_sq_sum` is Σᵢ βᵢ² and `het` is
the average heterozygosity 2p(1-p) (or its sum, depending on normalisation).

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_pgs.py`,
    `test_pgs_variance_from_het`). Realised PGS variance over 40000 individuals
    at 300 unlinked loci: worst 0.69 sems over a prediction spanning 49.77 to
    134.19, a factor of two and a half.

    Regime: linkage equilibrium. The formula sums per-locus contributions and
    drops the LD cross terms, the same qualifier `ScoreDistribution.pgsVariance`
    carries, where the omission was measured at 72 percent on a recombining
    panel. -/

/-- Target-population heterozygosity from a heterozygosity-loss fraction.

This definition carries no independent content: `fst` here is *defined* as the
proportional reduction `1 - H_target/H_source`, so `H_target = H_source (1 - fst)`
is that definition rearranged. It is true for every value of `fst`, which is
exactly why it cannot detect a wrong value supplied for `fst`.

Do not attach to it the claim that "after `t` generations of Wright-Fisher
drift with effective size N, `H_t = H_0 (1 - 1/(2N))^t`, giving
`Fst = 1 - (1 - 1/(2N))^t`". Both halves of that are wrong as
written. The recurrence holds only in the closed-population, no-mutation regime
-- at demographic equilibrium with `Ne = 1000`, `t = 4000` it predicts a
retention of `0.135` where the measurement is `1.025 ± 0.020`, an 86 percent
error -- and the resulting quantity is a within-population heterozygosity ratio,
not a between-population `F_ST`. Where that recurrence is wanted, construct a
`ClosedPopulationNoMutation` and use `ClosedPopulationNoMutation.targetHet`,
which carries the assumption in its type;
`ClosedPopulationNoMutation.targetHet_eq_targetHetFromFst` is the bridge.

    Empirical status: VACUOUS. This is an algebraic rearrangement of the
    definition of its own second argument, so no measurement can bear on it; the
    empirical content lives entirely in whatever supplies `fst`. -/

for every second argument, so it cannot detect a wrong one, and this says which one the

**One definition, and it is the composition rather than a re-typed product**: the
Fst-heterozygosity step is applied, not restated. A second body spelling `(1 - fst) * V_A`
directly would need a theorem to hold it in step, which is the failure this file's own
regime discussion is about.

**Which `fst` this means, declared rather than left to the argument name.** The
second argument of `pgsVarianceFromHet` is called `het`, so `1 - fst` is used here
as a **heterozygosity retention** `H_target / H_source`, and `fst` is the
proportional heterozygosity loss. That is not the between-population Hudson
`F_ST`, and the same distinction is spelled out at `targetHetFromFst` above. A
caller holding a Hudson value is asserting the extra claim that the two readings
coincide for its populations.

    Regime: heterozygosity-retention reading of `fst`; ancestral heterozygosities
    scaled by a common factor, which is what makes a single `fst` sufficient for a
    sum over loci.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/differential/cluster/fam_pgs_transport_drift.py`,

    `F_HET` reaches `0.295` and half the loci have fixed). Worst cell `0.94` sems
    on the retention reading. The grid does not by itself separate the two
    readings -- the Hudson reading also passes, worst cell `0.99` sems, the two
    predictions differing by at most `0.26` percent, at `F_HET 0.2953` against
    `F_HUDSON 0.2934` -- because a single deme drifting from its own ancestor
    makes them nearly equal. The declaration above, not that grid, is what says

    factors of two; the name alone does not pick one, and the docstring does.

    Power: the prediction spans 20.982 to 226.912 across the design, a factor
    of eleven. 
    **Re-confirmed at the argument the corpus actually feeds it, after a
    retraction** (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk17.py`). That
    battery set out to replace this body with `4 (1 - sqrt(1 - fst)) V_A` and
    reported it FALSIFIED at 14.72 sems, 38% low. The report was wrong and is
    withdrawn: the design drifted BOTH demes and then fed the PAIRWISE `fst`,
    which is precisely the two-branch-design-against-a-one-branch-law error the
    paragraph above already warns about. Making that same mistake a second time,
    with the warning sitting in the docstring being tested, is the reason it is
    recorded here rather than quietly fixed.

    Read at the argument the corpus supplies -- `expectedSqMeanPGSDiff_pureSplit`
    passes `fstS + fstT`, the SUM of the per-branch drift indices, not the
    pairwise value -- the same runs confirm this body exactly. Variances add
    over independent branches, so `Var(p_S - p_T) = (F_S + F_T) p0 (1 - p0)` and
    `Var(Delta mu) = 2 (F_S + F_T) V_A`, which is this body at `fst = fstS + fstT`:

      t     F_branch   2 (fstS + fstT) V_A   simulated              sems
       20     0.065           40.0            39.06 ± 1.01          0.97
       80     0.234          181.3           176.43 ± 4.56          1.06
      200     0.487          370.1           381.55 ± 9.85          1.16
      400     0.737          534.9           544.97 ± 14.07         0.72

    So the body is exact rather than first-order, and it is exact at `F_branch`
    up to 0.74 where any first-order law would have visibly failed. What looked
    like a defect was a convention error in the measurement.

/-- Exact present-day AUC under the equal-variance Gaussian model.

**NOT APPLICABLE TO DICHOTOMISED TRAITS. The word "liability" was in this docstring and
the formula is not the liability-threshold one.** The hypothesis actually used is that
case and control scores differ only by a mean shift with common residual variance `V_E`,
which is an equal-variance Gaussian *outcome*. Under a liability-threshold model the two
conditional variances are `v₁ = 1 - R²·i(i-T)` and `v₀ = 1 - R²·i_c(i_c-T)` and are **not**
equal, and no prevalence argument appears here at all.

Measured cost of the substitution on 400 simulated binary-trait PGS studies: bias
`-0.068` AUC, RMSE `0.071`, max error `0.120`. For a dichotomised trait use
`liabilityThresholdAUCFromExplainedR2` (RMSE `0.0121` on the same runs, against a `0.0120`

/-! Real-world PGS variance with both drift and LD tagging efficiency. -/
/-- The additive variance a score **explains** in a target population: the source
additive variance `V_A`, attenuated by the transported effect correlation `rhoSq`
and eroded by drift through `1 - fst`.

**This is a scope declaration, not a correction. The body is right; the one-line
reading of it as "the variance of the score" was wrong.** Write `bhat` for the
weights the deployed score actually carries, `b` for the true effects, `w` for the
ancestral per-locus heterozygosities `2p(1-p)`, and put

    A = Σ w bhat²,   B = Σ w b² = V_A,   C = Σ w bhat b,   rhoSq = C² / (A B).

In a target population whose heterozygosities are the ancestral ones scaled by
`1 - fst`:

* the **variance of the score itself** is `(1 - fst) A`;
* the variance of the part of the genetic value that the score predicts, i.e.
  `Cov(G, S)² / Var(S)`, is `(1 - fst) C² / A`, and *that* is this body.

The two agree exactly when `A = C`, i.e. when `Σ w bhat (bhat - b) = 0`: the
weights are calibrated, the residual `b - bhat` orthogonal to `bhat` in the
heterozygosity metric. Read this definition as the explained-variance one. It is
the reading the downstream `r2FromSignalVariance` compositions need, since only
explained variance can enter an `R²`, and it is the reading under which `rhoSq`
attenuates a covariance rather than inflating a variance.

`rhoSq` is meant in the heterozygosity metric `w` above, not as the plain
`corr(bhat, b)²` a reader computes from a table of effect estimates. Score
variance is a `w`-weighted quadratic form in the effects, so no other reading can
enter a variance identity at all. The choice is not cosmetic: at source `n = 500`
the measurement below found `0.63392` weighted against `0.36383` unweighted, the
weighted reading being 74 percent larger.

    Regime: calibrated weights; equivalently, the large-source-GWAS limit.
    Nothing in the body carries a sample size, and at finite source `n` raw
    marginal-OLS weights are not calibrated. To leading order in `1/n`,
    `E[C] = V_A` while `E[A] = V_A + Σ_j w_j Var(bhat_j) ≈ V_A + m V_P / n` over
    `m` loci at phenotypic variance `V_P`, the per-locus term having the shape of
    `HaplotypeTheory.haplotypeEffectVarianceOLS`. So `A > C`, and the score's own
    variance overshoots this body by the factor `(A / C)²`. The finite-`n` score
    variance is `(1 - fst)(V_A + m V_P / n)`; this body is unchanged, which is the
    point. Estimation noise inflates score variance without adding any covariance
    with the phenotype, so it cannot improve prediction, and the quantity defined
    here is the one that survives to an `R²`.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED as the explained-variance reading; FALSIFIED as
    a claim about the variance of a score built from finite-`n` weights**

    `V_A = 62.853`). Measured score variance against this body: at `n = 500`,
    `fst = 0`, `135.20 ± 0.49` against `39.84`; at `n = 2000`, `81.11 ± 0.24`
    against `55.18`; at `n = 20000`, `65.88 ± 0.26` against `61.88`; at
    `n = 20000`, `fst = 0.295`, `46.55 ± 0.71` against `43.64`. The gap is
    `95.4`, `25.9`, `3.99` across that `n` grid -- it falls as `1/n`, which is the
    signature of estimation noise and not of a wrong constant. Recovering the
    noise term `Σ w (bhat - b)²` from those cells gives `10.16` against the
    predicted `m V_P / n = 9.58` at `n = 2000` and `1.03` against `0.958` at
    `n = 20000`, so the mechanism above is the whole of the gap where the
    leading-order form applies. At `n = 500` it gives `51.3` against `38.3`,
    which is the leading-order form itself degrading: the ancestral spectrum
    there carries loci at `p = 0.01`, about ten minor-allele copies in a sample
    of 500, where `E[1 / Σ (g - ḡ)²]` is no longer `1 / (n w)`. The run's scale
    control reproduced additive variance to relative error `0.00e+00` and its
    corruption control fired to `27.9` sems where it must fire.

    One consequence of the scope. As `n → ∞` with weights carried on the causal
    variants, `rhoSq → 1` and this collapses to `presentDayPGSVariance`. The
    content of `rhoSq < 1` is therefore cross-population tagging loss, which is
    what the surrounding file means by it, and never source-GWAS estimation
    noise, which belongs in `V_A` instead: a score's `V_A` is the variance it
    explains in its own source population, already net of its own noise. -/

- novel direct target-only causal links via `novelDirectCausalTarget`
- proxy tagging via `proxyTaggingSource/Target`
- novel target-only proxy tagging via `novelProxyTaggingTarget`
- aggregate tag-to-causal structure via the derived
  `sigmaTagCausalSourceAt`
- causal-vs-tag distinction via separate tag and causal dimensions plus the
  direct-vs-proxy decomposition
- source and target LD among scored SNPs via `sigmaTagSource/Target`
- standing source/target effect architecture via `betaSource/Target`
- target-only novel causal effects via `novelCausalEffectTarget`
- ancestry-specific or environment-specific cross-covariance shifts via
  `contextCrossSource/Target`
- additive irreducible target-side losses derived from:
  broken tagging, ancestry-specific LD distortion, and source-specific
  overfit/context mismatch
- target-only phenotype variance from untagged novel causal mutations via
  `novelUntaggablePhenotypeVarianceTarget`
- source/target outcome scales and target prevalence for deployed metrics

**Simp direction changed here, and it affects every downstream file.** This name
was declared twice — once here, general in `P`, and once earlier in the file
specialised to `Pop.source` and spelling the right-hand side
`m.outcomeVariance Pop.source`. Two declarations of it would leave the specialised one in
the simp set, rewriting toward `m.outcomeVariance` at source only. There is one, so simp
rewrites toward `effectiveOutcomeVariance` at every `P`.

That is the direction the population index is going, and this statement is the
definitional unfolding of `residualVarianceFromSourceWeights`, which the
specialised one was not. But it is a behaviour change to a `@[simp]` lemma rather
than only a deletion, so if a downstream proof now normalises somewhere
unexpected, this is the cause. Reverting is one line — restore the specialised
copy and delete this — at the cost of losing the general form. -/

/-- Ohta-Kimura-style closed-form LD-correlation decay law across populations:
correlation decays exponentially with recombination distance and divergence.

    Empirical status: UNTESTED, with a LEAD AGAINST THE EXPONENTIAL SHAPE
    (`simcov/battery_bulk31.py`). Recorded as a lead and not a falsification,
    because the run carried no valid positive control -- the harness's own rule
    is that a disagreement without one has not shown the design can reproduce a
    known result.

    The lead: coalescent theory gives Sved's `r² ≈ 1/(1 + 4·Nₑ·c)`, which is
    HYPERBOLIC in distance, not exponential, and the two differ in shape rather
    than scale. Measured `r²` between common SNP pairs binned over an
    eightyfold distance range (`Nₑ = 1000`, 5 Mb at `1e-8`, 8 replicates), with
    BOTH laws fitted to the same curve with one free rate and one free
    amplitude each so neither is handicapped:

      distance    measured r²        exponential fit   hyperbolic fit
        10 kb     0.5900 ± 0.0162    0.2387            0.4682
        75 kb     0.1721 ± 0.0104    0.1977            0.2133
       300 kb     0.0781 ± 0.0031    0.1028            0.0739
      1200 kb     0.0295 ± 0.0015    0.0075            0.0205

    The exponential misses at BOTH ends -- 21.7 sems at the short end and 14.2
    sems at the long end, where it decays far too fast -- while the hyperbolic
    stays within a few sems across most of the range. That two-sided failure is
    the signature of a wrong shape rather than a wrong constant, so no choice of
    `lambda` repairs it.

    What would settle it: a control this design lacks. The obvious candidate,
    that the hyperbolic fit recovers the simulated `Nₑ`, does not work as one --
    it returned `Nₑ_eff = 563` against a true 1000, a known bias of `r²`
    estimated from 60 sampled chromosomes. A design with an independently known
    anchor is needed before either shape earns a verdict.

    THE `fstGap` FACTOR IS **FALSIFIED**, and the exponent is a SQUARE ROOT
    (`simcov/battery_bulk54.py`). `lambda` is free, so the absolute rate is not
    refutable; the SHAPE of the rate-versus-divergence relation is, with no free
    constant left once each candidate is anchored at one cell. Five migration
    rates spanning 120-fold in `m` give `F_ST` = 0.5558, 0.2374, 0.0951, 0.0322,
    0.0062 -- a ninetyfold span -- and the fitted decay rate tracks
    `√fstGap`, not `fstGap`:

      rate ∝ fstGap        FALSIFIED, worst 4.73 sems (95% relative)
      rate ∝ √fstGap       MATCH, worst 2.42 sems
      rate independent     19.35 sems off, though formally NO POWER since a
                           constant prediction has no span

    So the body is wrong in its `fstGap` dependence and right that there IS
    one: divergence does slow LD-correlation decay, at half the rate this body
    claims in the exponent. Replacing `fstGap` by `Real.sqrt fstGap` is what the
    measurement supports, and `lambda` absorbs the rest.

    An earlier run (`battery_bulk53.py`) reached the same conclusion and could
    not report it: it compared ONE fitted-rate ratio against ONE `F_ST` ratio,
    so the prediction span was zero and the power gate correctly refused a
    verdict. The fix was more cells, not a better estimator.

    The two leads are therefore in different states: the SHAPE in distance --
    exponential versus Sved's hyperbolic -- remains open for want of an
    independently anchored control, while the `fstGap` factor is settled here.
    A body carrying both faults would be wrong twice over, and only one of them
    is now established. -/

    The competing one-lineage reading `exp(-mu t)` is carried through the same
    measurement and misses by up to 433 sems and 174% relative, so the factor of

    wrong functional form no matter what else the design shows. The numbers
    above are from the redone design.

    A time SCALE has no empirical content in isolation: `t/(2 Ne)` can only be
    checked against something that consumes it, and the table above is the
    check. Halving or doubling this factor moves `exp(-theta * tau)` from 0.135

/-- Allele-frequency mismatch penalty. This penalizes transport when target
allele frequencies drift away from the source frequencies, even if the source
score itself is unchanged.

    Empirical status: **FALSIFIED** (`simcov/battery_bulk52.py`). Retention
    cannot be a function of the GAP alone, which is all this body is.

    The observable is the fraction of a variant's predictive contribution that
    survives transport: with a fixed effect, the ratio of realised
    score-phenotype covariance in the target to that in the source, over 3×10⁶
    individuals per population. Three cells share `|Δp| = 0.2` at different
    places in the unit interval:

      p_source  p_target   this body   measured retention
       0.50      0.30       0.9165      0.8418 ± 0.0014
       0.30      0.10       0.9165      0.4278 ± 0.0007
       0.70      0.50       0.9165      1.1926 ± 0.0020

    This body predicts the SAME number for all three, because it sees only
    `|Δp|`. The measurement spans a factor of nearly three across them. Worst
    cell 560 sems at 91% relative. That is a refutation of the SHAPE, not of a
    constant: no rescaling of an exponential in `|Δp|` can produce three
    different values from one gap.

    The third row is the sharper problem. Retention there EXCEEDS ONE -- moving
    a frequency from 0.7 toward 0.5 raises the variant's genotype variance and
    so its contribution -- and a quantity called a penalty, bounded above by one
    for every argument, cannot represent that at all.

    WHAT FITS: the genotype-variance ratio `2·p_t(1-p_t) / (2·p_s(1-p_s))`,
    carried on the same cells, MATCHES at worst 2.12 sems (0.35% relative). Its
    square root -- what a STANDARDIZED score would give -- is also falsified, at
    411 sems, so the exponent is settled too. Control: the counted source allele
    frequency recovers `pSource`, at 1.13 sems.

    Consequence: `tagAlleleFreqRetentionAt` and `causalAlleleFreqRetentionAt`
    are this body applied to their own frequencies and inherit the failure. -/

effects were identical to source effects.

    Regime: standardized variants; the LD operator is the tag-by-causal

    coordinates.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED** (`simcov/battery_bulk32.py`). What is on
    trial is the PROJECTION ITSELF -- that applying the LD cross-covariance to a
    causal effect vector yields the MARGINAL effects an association scan
    actually estimates. That is a fact about genotypes, not about algebra: the
    oracle regresses simulated phenotypes on simulated genotypes, one univariate
    regression per variant, and never forms the LD matrix from the effects.

    40 variants with AR(1) LD (`Σᵢⱼ = ρ^|i-j|`, `ρ` swept 0.4 to 0.9), four
    causal among them, 400000 individuals. Agreement is read at the

    a local miss, with the error bar inflated by `√(2 log 40)` for that

    Power: two competing forms ride on the same cells. Dropping the projection
    entirely -- taking the marginal effect to BE the causal effect -- misses by
    up to 61 sems; applying the projection TWICE, which is what an `r` versus
    `r²` confusion looks like at the vector level, is FALSIFIED at 539 sems.
    Control: the realised genetic variance reproduces `βᵀΣβ` on the same run,
    passing at 0.29 sems.

A symmetric design cannot rescue it. With equal branch lengths both sides of the ratio
collapse to about `1`, so a symmetric test has no power to reject a wrong functional form,
and an agreement to `3.2%` measured that way is an artifact.
`Calibrator.DriftRegime.symmetric_design_has_no_power` proves that on any symmetric design
this form and its *square* are indistinguishable.

The defect is not a miscalibration, it is the wrong argument list. The observed ratio is
`2.2` to `6.5` and is driven by the tenfold ratio in effective size, not by `F_ST`:
heterozygosity is governed by `Nₑ` and the mutation floor `hetMutationFloor`, and `F_ST` is a
between-population variance ratio that does not determine either.

**The falsification needs no definition to state**, which is why it survives the deletion.
`benchmarkRatioForm_cannot_reach_measured` below states it about the expression written out,
and is the machine-checked form of "no argument brings this formula into the measured range".
A certificate that can only be stated about a name is hostage to that name.

Nothing replaces it. `hetRatioBetweenBranches` below is a clearly-labelled candidate for
testing, and is a function of the two effective sizes, the mutation rate and the horizon,
which is what the data say the quantity depends on. `DriftRegime.benchmarkRatio` is NOT
this quantity and carries none of this: measurement confirms that form to `-0.003%`, and
what fails there is a different quantity fed into its `fst` slot. -/

/-- **The measured value is outside the range of the heterozygosity-ratio-from-`F_ST` form,
stated about the expression rather than about a name.**

At the design point `fstSource = 0.3577` the form `(1 - fstT)/(1 - fstS)` is below `3` for
every target `F_ST` in range -- its supremum there is `1/(1 - 0.3577) = 1.557`. The measured
heterozygosity ratio at that point is `3.79 ± 0.25`, more than nine standard errors above
`3`. This is the falsification in a form that depends on neither the simulation being rerun
nor the definition continuing to exist: no choice of the free argument brings the expression
into the measured range. -/

    quantile of 4×10⁶ standard-normal liabilities. Over `K` = 0.01, 0.05, 0.2,
    0.5, 0.8 the body predicts +2.32635, +1.64485, +0.84162, 0 and -0.84162

    at 0.13% relative.

    Power: `K` is swept from the far tail to above the median, so the threshold
    CHANGES SIGN across the design. The sign slip `Φ⁻¹(K)` -- which is what
    writing the tail the wrong way round produces -- misses by up to 3113 sems
    and 200% relative, and coincides with the body only at `K = 1/2` where both
    are zero. That is the one place the two readings are indistinguishable, and
    the design does not rest there.

    The competing form is recorded as a lead rather than a falsification
    because this run's control was DEGENERATE: it counted the tail mass above
    the MEASURED quantile, which is `K` by construction of a quantile and so
    cannot fail. The harness detected that. The MATCH above needs no control. -/

/-! **Deleted: `LiabilityThresholdRegime`.**

An *obligation* structure with no consumer is worse than an unused lemma. Its whole claim
is that somebody must discharge these conditions before using the formula, and nobody does,
so it reads as rigour from the outside while every real use site bypasses it.

Three of the seven fields are results rather than domain conditions, so any use of the
structure would import them unproved:

* `threshold_spec : Phi (liabilityThreshold K) = 1 - K`. Since `liabilityThreshold K` is
  `Function.invFun Phi (1 - K)`, this says `Phi` hits `1 - K`, i.e. that the standard
  normal CDF is onto `(0, 1)`. That is a theorem — continuity plus the limits at `±∞` plus
  the intermediate value theorem — and it is *derivable* from `prevalence_pos` and
  `prevalence_lt_one`, which is exactly why it should not have been assumed alongside
  them. `Calibrator.Probability` defines `Phi` and proves nothing about it, so the
  derivation is not currently available; supplying it is the honest way to reinstate this.
* `caseVariance_pos` and `controlVariance_pos`. These are not conditions a caller can
  choose to meet: `liabilityCaseVariance r2 K` is a closed formula in `r2` and `K`, so its
  positivity is true or false once those are fixed. Both follow from `0 ≤ r2 < 1` together
  with the truncated-normal bound `0 ≤ i·(i - T) ≤ 1` on the selection intensity, which is
  the standard fact that truncation cannot increase variance. That bound is a real result
  and the corpus does not have it.

Reinstating this regime honestly means proving those three, not restating them. Until
then, the four genuine domain conditions (`0 < K < 1`, `0 ≤ r2 < 1`) are what the
individual theorems below already take as explicit hypotheses where they need them. -/

/-- Exact **equal-variance Gaussian** AUC as a function of SNR:
`AUC = Φ(√(snr/2))`.

    This is the AUC when cases and controls are two normals of equal variance
    separated by `√snr`. It is *not* the liability-threshold AUC, under which
    cases are a truncated tail, so the two distributions have different
    variances and the separation depends on where the truncation falls. It was
    named and documented as the liability AUC, twice as "exact".

    Numerical integration over the bivariate normal, agreeing with a
    4·10⁶-draw Monte Carlo to about `0.001`, puts the error at 3% to 26%,
    always understating, and worst where it matters most: at `R² = 0.3` the
    true AUC runs from `0.753` at prevalence `0.5` to `0.921` at `0.001`,
    while this returns one number per `R²` because it takes no prevalence.
    That missing argument is why no constant could repair it.

    Empirical status: VALIDATED for the equal-variance Gaussian model it now
    names; FALSIFIED as the liability-threshold AUC. The binary-trait
    counterpart is `liabilityThresholdAUCFromExplainedR2`, which takes the
    prevalence this one lacks and measures at RMSE `0.0121` where this form is
    biased `-0.068`.

    Power: this chart's own prediction spans `0.760250`, `0.921350`, `0.999797`
    and `1.000000` at `snr = 1, 4, 25, 100`, which is the design the
    two-Gaussian Monte Carlo of `DGP.equalVarianceGaussianAUCFromSignalVariance`
    was run on, at `200000` draws per point; the two are the same chart under
    `snr = vSignal / vNoise`, and
    `equalVarianceGaussianAUCFromSNR_eq_variance` is the theorem saying so, so
    the measurement is of this function rather than of a sibling formula. The

/-! ### WHY A RANGE CHECK COULD NOT CATCH THIS, WHICH IS THE POINT

Ten definitions in this AUC family were flagged by the range checker as **provably unable
to fail**: their bound is `Φ`'s codomain, so "the result lies in `[0,1]`" is a fact about
`Phi` and says nothing whatever about the body. They were counted as covered while being
structurally incapable of detecting the defect below.

**A check that verifies "is it a probability" cannot catch "is it the right probability."**
The equal-variance form returns a perfectly well-formed number in `[0,1]` and is biased by
seven AUC points on dichotomised traits. Every range check passes; the biology is wrong.

This is the concrete instance the vacuity investigation was looking for. The general lesson
is that a bound inherited from a codomain is not evidence about a definition, and a coverage
count that credits such bounds is counting something other than what its name says.

### The liability-threshold AUC, which is the one binary traits need

`equalVarianceGaussianAUCFromExplainedR2` is a true theorem about the equal-variance
Gaussian model and the **wrong formula for a dichotomised trait**, which is most of what
polygenic scores are used for. Its own docstring already recorded
`FALSIFIED as the liability-threshold AUC`; what was missing was the right formula, not a
correction to that one. Both are kept, and each names the other and the regime that selects
it, because the defect was never that either was false — it was that nothing said when each
applies.

The formula below is **classical**: it is the liability-threshold result of Wray et al.
(2010), *The genetic interpretation of area under the ROC curve*, in the same way the
Gaussian information constants and van Trees are classical components named as such. The
contribution here is not the derivation; it is that the corpus carried only the
equal-variance form for binary traits, and that this one has been measured. -/

/-! The liability-threshold primitives and their regime are declared before
the first binary-trait profile above. The substantive comparison starts here,
after the equal-variance chart has also been declared. -/

/-- **The two AUC maps are not the same function, and must not be collapsed into one.**

The equal-variance form takes no prevalence argument, so it is constant in `K`; the
liability form is not. Hence if the liability AUC differs between *any* two prevalences at a
fixed `r2` — which is what the 400-run validation measures, the fitted `K` moving the
prediction by far more than the `0.0120` noise floor — then no identity can equate the two
maps.

This exists to stop a later simplification from quietly identifying them. The hypothesis is
the empirical fact, supplied rather than assumed, in the same way
`NearLowDimensionalFamily` is carried elsewhere. -/

holds for every prevalence in `(0,1)`, because `i_c` is a negative multiple of `i`. -/

/-- **Target AUC from the neutral allele-frequency benchmark, for a DICHOTOMISED trait.**

Prevalence `K` is a **required argument**, and that is the whole design. The failure this
replaces was not that someone chose a wrong prevalence — it was that no prevalence was ever
named, so a drift-induced `R²` drop was converted into AUC units by a formula that has no
place to put one. Making `K` mandatory turns a silently biased number into a call that does
not elaborate until whoever owns the call site supplies the prevalence, which is the person
who knows it.

This is the conversion to use for a binary trait. For a genuinely **continuous** outcome the
equal-variance chart is correct and `presentDayEqualVarianceGaussianAUC` is the one to call.

plus environment. With `h_split` supplied, `r2 / (1 - r2)` *is* that ratio, and this form
reduces to the one already discharged.

    factor cancelled inside a cross-identity and survived it -- so checking it
    against a measurement rather than against a sibling formula is the point.

## Mutation-Drift Balance and Portability

When mutation is non-negligible, Fst has a finite equilibrium (Wright's
1/(1+4Neμ)) instead of approaching 1. This section generalizes the drift-only
portability model to include mutation as a first-class parameter.

Key results:
1. Generalized divergence model that includes mutation rate
2. Covariance divergence including both drift and mutation terms
3. Portability under mutation-drift: mutation-generated population-specific
   variants reduce tagging efficiency
4. Comparison: mutation-drift equilibrium portability vs pure-drift portability
-/

/-- **One generation of the identity-by-descent balance.**

`F` is the probability that two gene copies drawn from the same subpopulation
are identical by descent (equivalently, `F_ST` measured against a total
population in which that probability is zero).  In one generation:

* drift makes a pair identical with probability `1/(2 Nₑ)` among the pairs that
  are not already identical, contributing `+(1 - F)/(2 Nₑ)`;
* each of the two lineages independently escapes the local identity class at
  rate `rate` -- by mutating away from its ancestral allelic state, or by being
  replaced by a migrant -- contributing `-2 · rate · F`.

`rate` is therefore whichever homogenising force is in play: `μ` for
mutation-drift balance, `m` for migration-drift balance, `μ + m` for both.
That the two forces enter identically is the whole content of
`islandModelFst_eq_mutationForm`.

Composition convention: this is the first-order (weak-force, large-`Nₑ`)
recursion, in which drift and the homogenising force are *added*, so their
within-generation ordering does not matter.  The unlinearised discrete-generation
recursion multiplies them instead -- see `islandFstMultiplicativeStep` -- and its fixed
point differs from this one at O(rate², rate/Nₑ).

    **Attribution, corrected.** This is *not* the Wright (1931) island-model
    result, which this file also carries at `fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium` and
    which is `1/(1 + 4·Nₑ·m)` in the MIGRATION rate. The mutation-drift form is
    Malécot's `(4Nu + 1)⁻¹`, standardly cited to Kimura and Crow (1964),
    *The Number of Alleles That Can Be Maintained in a Finite Population*,
    Genetics 49:725--738. The two laws share the algebraic shape `1/(1 + 4·Nₑ·rate)`
    -- that shared shape is the whole content of `ibdFlowStep_fixedPoint`, which
    proves it once for an abstract `rate` -- and they are different results about
    different forces. A docstring that names the wrong one invites a reader to
    substitute `m` for `μ` on the authority of a citation that does not cover it.

    Convention: despite the `Fst` in the name (inherited from
    `DGP.fstMutationDriftEquilibrium`, whose docstring says the same thing), the
    quantity is the probability that two gene copies drawn at random from ONE
    population are identical by descent -- the complement of the equilibrium
    heterozygosity `θ/(1+θ)` at `PortabilityDrift.hetMutationFloor`. It is not a
    between-population differentiation measure.

    Not stipulated: `MutationDriftModelAssumptions.fstEquilibrium_isFixedPoint`
    derives it as the rest point of `ibdFlowStep` with `rate = μ`.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**, by projection. This body IS
    `DGP.fstMutationDriftEquilibrium m.theta` -- not an analogue of it, the same
    function applied to this structure's field -- so the measurement there
    transfers without a separate design. That run is `simcov/battery_bulk19.py`
    against `msprime`'s `InfiniteAlleles` model, worst cell 2.40 sems, with `Nₑ`
    and `μ` swept by a factor of four INDEPENDENTLY so each `θ` is reached twice
    by different routes; `simcov/battery_bulk20b.py` corroborates from the
    complementary side, measuring `θ/(1+θ)` over a hundredfold `θ` sweep at
    worst 2.17 sems with an Ewens allele-count control passing at 1.10 sems.

    What does NOT transfer is the reading of the name: `fst` here is the
    probability that two alleles drawn WITHIN a population are identical by
    state, the complement of heterozygosity, and not a between-population
    differentiation. The measurement above is of that within-population
    quantity. A consumer wanting differentiation wants
    `DGP.EvolutionaryParameters.fstEquilibrium`, which is separately FALSIFIED
    -- so the two must not be substituted for one another. -/

    `θ = 4·Nₑ·μ`.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED on its RATE**
    (`simcov/battery_bulk24.py`). The body makes two separable claims -- a
    plateau `Fst_eq` and a time constant `τ = 2·Nₑ/(1+θ)` -- and only the second
    is convention-free. Whether the plateau is Nei's `G_ST`, Hudson's `F_ST` or
    a per-branch drift `F` moves it by factors of two and four, and this corpus
    has already lost a factor of four to exactly that. Rescaling `F_ST` by any
    constant leaves `τ` untouched. So the design fits `A·(1 - exp(-t/τ))` to the
    measured trajectory, DISCARDS the amplitude `A`, and puts `τ` on trial:

      Nₑ     θ      τ measured      2·Nₑ/(1+θ)    sems
      500    0.5    668 ± 45        667           0.03

      1000   0.1    1661 ± 71       1818          2.22

    Worst cell 2.22 sems. `Nₑ` and `θ` are swept separately, so the two scalings
    are separately falsifiable; holding `θ = 0.5` and doubling `Nₑ` moves `τ` by
    a factor of 1.996 against 2.000 predicted.

    Power, and why this is a measurement rather than an identity: the drift-only
    rate `τ = 2·Nₑ`, which drops the mutation term, is carried on the SAME cells
    and is FALSIFIED at up to 9.96 sems (50% relative). An oracle algebraically
    pinned to the body could not reject a competing form -- the "measurement"
    would move with whatever prediction was fed in -- so the rejection is what
    establishes that `τ` was measured and not recomputed. The control, a
    `θ = 0.02` cell where both candidate rates coincide, passed at 0.15 sems.

    LIMITS OF THIS RUN, recorded rather than smoothed over. The `θ = 0.5` and
    `θ = 1.0` cells fit amplitudes `A` of 1.13 and 1.59 -- an `F_ST` above one,
    which is unphysical and marks Hudson's ratio-of-averages estimator degrading
    under multiple hits. The `τ` estimate survives because `A` is discarded by
    construction, but those cells are weaker than their error bars suggest.
    Above `θ ≈ 1` the design fails outright: under infinite sites `θ` is set by
    `μ` at fixed `Nₑ`, so `θ = 3` at `Nₑ = 500` needs `μ = 1.5e-3` per site,
    five orders above realistic, and produces a genotype matrix too large to
    build. Testing the `(1+θ)` factor further needs a finite-sites model or
    branch-mode statistics, not this instrument. -/

/-! ## Derivation of the Multiplicative Covariance Divergence Formula

We derive the formula `covarianceDivergenceMutationDrift(Fst, shared_LD) = 1 - (1-Fst) × shared_LD`
from the covariance between a polygenic score and a phenotype across populations.

**Setup.** In the source population, the covariance between a PGS and the phenotype is:

  `Cov(PGS, Y_source) = Σᵢ βᵢ × Cov(Gᵢ_source, Y_source)`

In the target population:

  `Cov(PGS, Y_target) = Σᵢ βᵢ × Cov(Gᵢ_target, Y_target)`

The ratio `Cov_target / Cov_source` depends on two independent factors:

1. **Allele frequency correlation** (`freq_corr`): Genetic drift changes allele frequencies
   between populations. The correlation of allele frequencies between source and target
   populations is `1 - Fst`, where Fst measures frequency divergence. This scales the
   per-locus genetic covariance by `(1 - Fst)`.

2. **LD overlap** (`ld_overlap`): New mutations and recombination alter LD patterns.
   The fraction of LD structure that is shared between populations is `shared_LD`.
   Only shared LD contributes to tagging of causal variants by the PGS SNPs.

For a single locus pair, these act on different aspects of the covariance:
- Frequency change scales the marginal genetic variance: `Var(G_target) ∝ (1-Fst) × Var(G_source)`
- LD change scales the tagging efficiency: `r²_target ∝ shared_LD × r²_source`

Because these are independent mechanisms, the total covariance retention is their product:

  `Cov_target / Cov_source = (1 - Fst) × shared_LD`

Therefore the divergence (fraction of covariance lost) is:

  `divergence = 1 - retention = 1 - (1 - Fst) × shared_LD`
-/

/-- **Covariance retention** across populations.
    The fraction of PGS-phenotype covariance retained in the target population
    is the product of allele frequency correlation and LD overlap. These two
    factors are independent: frequency drift scales per-locus genetic variance,
    while LD decay scales tagging efficiency. -/
noncomputable def covarianceRetention (freq_corr ld_overlap : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  freq_corr * ld_overlap

/-- Allele frequency correlation equals `1 - Fst`, where Fst measures the
    fraction of genetic variance due to population divergence.

    Empirical status: **FALSIFIED** as a function of `F_ST`
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_verify.py`,
    `test_freq_corr_killer`). Two Wright-Fisher designs were run to the SAME
    differentiation -- `G_ST` 0.0749 and 0.0750, so `1 - Fst` is 0.9251 and
    0.9250 -- differing only in the ancestral frequencies the two demes started
    from. `Ne = 200`, 60 generations, 4000 loci, 400 replicate deme pairs, the
    correlation taken within each replicate so its scatter is measured:

      ancestral p0            1 - Fst    measured corr    sems off
      all p0 = 0.5             0.9251    0.0004±0.0008      1117
      uniform(0.05, 0.95)      0.9250    0.7209±0.0003       653

    At identical `F_ST` the correlation is either zero or 0.72, so it is not a
    function of `F_ST` and no repair of the constant can make it one. The
    degenerate row is the clearest statement of the mechanism: when every locus
    starts at the same ancestral frequency there is no across-locus signal for
    the two demes to share, and the correlation vanishes however little they
    have diverged.

    What the quantity actually is:
    `corr(p1, p2) = Var(p0) / (Var(p0) + F * E[p0 (1 - p0)])`,
    which depends on the ancestral spread as well as on the drift index, and
    reduces to `1 - F` only when `Var(p0)` and `E[p0 (1 - p0)]` stand in one
    particular ratio.

    Power: the design holds `F_ST` fixed to four decimal places and moves the
    measured correlation from 0.0004 to 0.7209, which is the largest span the
    quantity admits.

    **The name has been changed.** This was `freqCorrFromFst`, and that name is
    the falsified claim: it asserted that `1 - Fst` IS the allele-frequency
    correlation, which the measurement above refutes. The body `1 - Fst` is
    retained because it is what every consumer actually uses it as -- a
    covariance-retention factor -- and the new name says only that. The
    correlation itself is `alleleFreqCorrelation` below, which carries the
    arguments the quantity depends on.

    Empirical status: UNTESTED as a covariance-retention factor. Its former
    justification was the correlation identity, and that justification is gone;
    retention needs a measurement of its own and has not had one.

    Denotes: the covariance-retention factor, not the allele-frequency
    correlation. The same body `1 - fst` appears under names from 'correlation',
    'retention' and 'drift factor', and the formula alone does not fix which is

    `corr(p1, p2) = Var(p0) / (Var(p0) + fst * E[p0 (1 - p0)])`, where the two
    ancestral moments are taken over the loci scored. Both demes descend from
    one ancestral population, so their frequencies share exactly the ancestral
    across-locus spread and differ by independent drift; the correlation is the
    ratio of the shared part to the total, which is what this states.

like a statement about `R²`. The identity is `presentDayPGSVarianceMutationDrift_eq` with
the factors reassociated, and `mutationDrift_variance_ratio` just above states the same
content as a ratio with the hypotheses it genuinely needs.

Two of those hypotheses are worse than unused. `0 ≤ fst` and `fst < 1` are the range in
which the "correction factor" reading means anything, and leaving them unused lets the

## Migration-Drift Balance and Portability

Gene flow (migration) between populations counteracts drift, preventing complete
differentiation. The classic Wright island model gives Fst ≈ 1/(1 + 4Nm) at
equilibrium. This section extends the `SplitMigrationModel` with:
1. Fst under migration-drift equilibrium and its properties
2. Migration reduces Fst relative to pure drift
3. Stepping-stone model: Fst increases with geographic distance
4. Migration's effect on LD sharing and PGS portability
5. Portability is higher with gene flow than without
6. Asymmetric migration and directional portability
7. Admixture LD from recent migration pulses

/-- The finite-island correction factor `d/(d-1)` for `demes` demes.

Convention: this is the correction as it enters the HUDSON coalescence-time
`F_ST`, where it appears LINEARLY: `1/(1 + 4·Nₑ·m·d/(d-1))`. The widely quoted
Crow--Aoki (1984) finite-island formula carries `(d/(d-1))²`, but that is the
correction for Nei's `G_ST`, a different statistic. Do not read this factor as
the square's base and then square it; `PopulationGeneticsFoundations`'
`islandDemeCorrection` carries the measurement that excludes the square under
this corpus's convention, at 9.04 sems, and `islandFstFiniteDemes` carries the
attribution for both forms.

This is data, not a packaged claim that an approximation is adequate.  Any biological
use of the infinite-island approximation must compare this explicit quantity with its
own scientifically justified tolerance. -/

    Regime: the infinite-island limit. The explicit `finiteIslandCorrection`
    above makes the finite-deme discrepancy inspectable. Simulation puts the law within 2% at 40
    demes, but +17% at 10, +31% at 5 and +95% at 2. The two-deme case is the

/-- **One generation of the identity-by-descent recurrence.**

A lineage pair coalesces this generation with probability `1/(2 Nₑ)`; failing
that it is identical only if it already was. Independently, the pair survives
the disrupting event -- whatever separates the two lineages -- with probability
`(1 - rate)²`, one chance per lineage.

    Denotes: the recurrence itself, not either quantity that satisfies it. Read
    with `rate = m` it is the island-model single-locus IBD recursion; read with
    `rate = c` it is Sved's two-locus IBD recursion for `E[r²]`. Those are
    different quantities obeying one map, so the map is named for the map and
    for neither of them.

Composition convention: the disrupting event acts on the offspring generation
*after* reproduction, and the two events multiply rather than add. This is the
difference from `ibdFlowStep`, which linearises `(1 - rate)² (1 - 1/(2 Nₑ))` to
`1 - 2 rate - 1/(2 Nₑ)` and therefore has a different fixed point.

    3000 loci, migration then drift then two-way mutation each generation,
    `F_ST` read as `Var_between(p) / (pbar (1 - pbar))`. Tested as a ONE-STEP
    map: predict `F_{t+1}` from the measured `F_t` at each of 350 generations
    past the transient, then compare against the measured `F_{t+1}`.

were exact. One statement covers both readings: `1/(1 + 4 Nₑ m)` for the island
model and Sved's `1/(1 + 4 Nₑ c)` for two-locus LD are the same weak-rate
linearisation of `ibdRecurrenceFixedPoint`, each overstates it, and the gap is
the second-order term of `ibdRecurrenceFixedPoint_sub_linearisation`. At
`Nₑ = 1`, `rate = 1/2` the rest point is `1/7` and the linearisation is `1/3`.

Regime of the linearisation: small `rate`, large `Nₑ`. Outside it the corpus
already records a roughly twofold discrepancy at two demes on the island-model
definitions, and this theorem says the discrepancy has a sign. -/

    five orders of magnitude apart. A transposed forwarding would return
    6.7e+06, 1.8e+06 and 2.3e+07 in the three rows against a measurement near
    0.1: the check has a margin of seven orders of magnitude, rather than the

/-! **Deleted: `migration_reduces_fst_vs_pure_drift`.**

This theorem is absent on purpose. Its hypothesis is
`1 / (1 + 4 * Ne * m) < t / (t + 2 * Ne)` and its conclusion is
`fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium Ne m < t / (t + 2 * Ne)`. Since
`fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium Ne m` unfolds to `1 / (1 + 4 * Ne * m)`, the two are the same
proposition and the proof is `unfold; exact h_large_t` — the hypothesis, returned. The
remaining three hypotheses (`0 < Ne`, `0 < m`, `0 < t`) go unused.

The prose around it claims the derivation the theorem skips: "Under migration-drift
equilibrium, Fst = 1/(1+4Nm) < 1 - (1-1/(2Ne))^t for sufficiently large t." Nothing
establishes *for which* `t` the inequality holds. That is exactly what the hypothesis
assumes, under a name (`h_large_t`) that asserts the answer. Establishing it would mean
showing `1/(1+4Nm) < t/(t+2Ne)` for `t` past an explicit threshold in `Ne` and `m`, which
is a real result and appears nowhere in this file.

A result that merely repackages a premise is deleted, not renamed: there is no honest name
for `h → h`. -/

/-- **Finite equilibrium vs unbounded drift.**
    Under pure drift, Fst approaches 1 as t → ∞. Under migration-drift balance,

/-! ### 3. Stepping-stone model: Fst increases with geographic distance -/

/-- **Stepping-stone Fst model.**
    In the stepping-stone model, migration occurs only between adjacent demes.
    Fst between demes separated by d steps saturates:
    Fst(d) = d · Fst_neighbor / (Fst_neighbor · d + α · (1 - Fst_neighbor))
    which is `d / (d + K)` with characteristic scale `K = α (1 - Fst_neighbor)/Fst_neighbor`.
    `α` is the unit of distance -- it rescales that scale -- and at `α = 1` the form
    reproduces its own anchor, `Fst(1) = Fst_neighbor`.

    **This body was corrected.** It previously read
    `min 1 (Fst_neighbor × (1 + α × (d - 1)))`, linear in the separation and held inside
    `[0,1]` by an outer clamp. That form is FALSIFIED and the saturating one is measured;
    the evidence is below. Two theorems changed with it:
    `steppingStoneFst_eq_one_of_saturated` is gone, replaced by `steppingStoneFst_lt_one`
    which says the opposite, because a saturating form approaches complete
    differentiation without ever attaining it at finite separation; and
    `steppingStoneFst_increases_with_distance` no longer needs a below-saturation
    hypothesis, since `d/(d+K)` rises at every separation while the clamped linear form
    stopped rising once it hit the clamp.

    The `min 1` is not cosmetic. An `F_ST` is a variance ratio and lies in
    `[0, 1]`; the bare linear form returns `10000` at
    `fst_neighbor = 1, α = 1, d = 10000`, which is not a value the quantity can
    take. Clamping also makes the fixation boundary attainable rather than
    merely approached: `steppingStoneFst_eq_one_of_saturated` exhibits the
    regime where distant demes are completely differentiated, which is the
    physically correct behaviour of isolation by distance at long range.

    Regime: all separations. The saturating form needs no below-saturation proviso,
    which is the practical gain from the correction: the previous body was declared
    trustworthy only while `fst_neighbor * (1 + α (d - 1))` stayed well below `1`, and it
    failed INSIDE that declared regime -- at `d = 3` the measured `F_ST` is `0.123`,
    nowhere near saturation, and the linear form is 12% high there. A regime restriction
    does not rescue a body that is wrong inside its own regime. The companion
    saturating closed form is `demoSteppingStoneFst` in
    `Calibrator.DemographicHistory`, which is derived from a coalescence time,
    which is not this function and is not being replaced here. A second
    saturating form, `continuousSteppingStoneFst = 1 - exp (-d/L)`, has been
    deleted from `Calibrator.PopulationGeneticsFoundations`: it contradicted
    `demoSteppingStoneFst`, and the coalescent derivation decides against the
    exponential.

    Empirical status: **FALSIFIED** in its distance dependence
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk11.py`). The body says
    `F_ST` grows LINEARLY in the separation `d`, capped at one. Measured on a
    20-deme 1D stepping stone, `Ne = 500`, `m = 0.01`, interior demes only so no
    boundary reflection enters, `F_ST` read from coalescence times so no
    estimator convention enters, 26 replicates of 6 Mb:

      d    measured F_ST      linear (alpha from d=2)   saturating d/(d+K)
      1    0.05073±0.00285          --                        --

      5    0.18782±0.00399    0.23403  (11.6 sems)       K = 21.62
      8    0.27945±0.00605    0.37151  (15.2 sems)       K = 20.63

    `alpha` is fitted at `d = 2` and used to predict the rest, because a form
    fitted to every point agrees with anything monotone. The linear form then
    overshoots by 33 percent at `d = 8`, which is what a function without
    saturation must do once the separation is large enough.

    The sibling `DemographicHistory.demoSteppingStoneFst`, which saturates,
    describes the SAME runs far better: its `K = d(1-F)/F` should be constant
    and comes out 18.71, 19.27, 21.62, 20.63 -- a 15 percent drift rather than
    33, and no systematic overshoot. That head-to-head on one dataset is the
    evidence here, not a control cell that could only agree with itself.

    Neither form is exact. The residual drift in `K` says the saturating form is
    also approximate at these separations, and pinning the true `d`-dependence
    is not attempted here.

    Power: the measurement spans 0.05073 to 0.27945, a factor of five and a
    half, and the two candidate forms diverge monotonically across it. 
    **The correction, measured head to head**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk17.py`). Same 20-deme lattice,
    `Ne = 500`, `m = 0.01`, interior demes only, `F_ST` from coalescence times, 22
    replicates of 4 Mb. The comparison was deliberately STACKED AGAINST the replacement:
    the linear form was given a free `α` fitted at `d = 2`, while the saturating candidate
    was given nothing but `F(1)` and `α = 1`.

      d    measured F_ST        linear (free α)        saturating (no free parameter)
      1    0.04887 ± 0.00400     anchor                 anchor
      2    0.09378 ± 0.00379     fitted                 --
      3    0.12319 ± 0.00570    0.13869  (2.72 sems)   0.13357  (1.82 sems)
      5    0.20518 ± 0.00574    0.22850  (4.06 sems)   0.20441  (0.13 sems)
      8    0.27555 ± 0.00845    0.36322 (10.38 sems)   0.29132  (1.87 sems)

    The linear form is FALSIFIED at 10.38 sems and 31.8% relative with a fitted
    parameter in hand; the saturating form matches at 1.87 sems with none. The failure
    grows monotonically in `d`, which is the signature of a wrong functional form rather
    than a wrong constant.

    This reproduces `battery_bulk11.py`, which reached the same conclusion on a separate
    lattice realisation with different seeds and 26 replicates of 6 Mb, so the finding
    does not rest on one run.

/-! ### 4. Migration's effect on LD: gene flow homogenizes LD patterns -/

/-! #### Derivation of shared LD fraction from Fst equilibrium

The shared LD fraction under migration-drift balance is **derived**, not assumed.
Since Fst measures the fraction of genetic variation that is *between* populations,
the complementary quantity `1 - Fst` measures the fraction that is *shared*.
LD patterns are shared to the same extent as allele frequencies, so:

  shared_LD = 1 - Fst_eq = 1 - 1/(1 + M) = M/(1 + M)

where M = 4Nm is the scaled migration rate. This is the same algebraic identity
underlying Wright's island model: Fst + shared fraction = 1. The theorem
`sharedLD_from_equilibrium_eq` below proves this algebraically from the
already-derived `fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium`. -/

/-- **Shared LD derived from Fst equilibrium.**
    Defined as `1 - fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium Ne m`, i.e., the complement
    of the between-population divergence under migration-drift balance.

    Regime: two-deme island model at migration-drift balance. "Shared LD" is
    read as the correlation, across SNP pairs, between the signed LD `r`
    measured separately in each deme -- a property of PAIRS of sites, where
    `F_ST` is a property of single sites. They are different observables, which
    is what makes the identity refutable rather than algebraic.

    Empirical status: **FALSIFIED** outside the weak-differentiation limit
    (`simcov/battery_bulk34.py`). Measured at `Nₑ = 1000` over 5 Mb with
    recombination, `4·Nₑ·m` swept a hundredfold:

      4Nₑm    F_ST              shared LD          1 - F_ST
      0.4     0.5606 ± 0.0192   0.9060 ± 0.0132    0.4394
      2.0     0.2079 ± 0.0151   0.9341 ± 0.0054    0.7921
      8.0     0.0710 ± 0.0065   0.9674 ± 0.0021    0.9290
      40      0.0136 ± 0.0014   0.9890 ± 0.0005    0.9864

    Worst cell 35 sems, 52% relative. The law is accurate where `F_ST` is small
    -- at `4·Nₑ·m = 40` it predicts 0.9864 against 0.9890 measured -- and fails
    badly once `F_ST` exceeds roughly 0.2, where it predicts 0.44 against 0.91
    measured, low by a factor of two. LD structure is set largely by shared
    ancestral recombination history, and that persists long after allele
    frequencies have drifted apart; `1 - F_ST` has no term for it.

    No nearby variant rescues the shape: `(1 - F)²` is falsified at 56 sems and
    `1 - 2F` at 78 sems on the same cells. That all three fail while the
    pipeline reproduces its control is what makes this a statement about the
    law rather than about the measurement.

    Control: one panmictic population whose samples are split into two arbitrary
    halves, run through the SAME estimators, filters and pair selection --
    `F_ST = 0.0015`, indistinguishable from zero. That run also quantifies the
    only known bias in the shared-LD estimator: correlating two noisy per-deme
    estimates of `r` attenuates the correlation to 0.9945 rather than 1, a
    0.55% one-sided effect identical across cells and two orders of magnitude
    too small to produce the gap above.

    Consequence: `signalRetentionMigrationDrift` and
    `retainedSignalVarianceMigrationDrift` consume this fraction, so their
    values inherit the error wherever `F_ST` is not small. -/

/-- **Shared LD fraction under migration-drift balance.**
    Gene flow homogenizes LD patterns between populations. The fraction of LD
    that is shared between two demes increases with migration rate:
    shared_LD(m) = M / (1 + M) where M = 4Nm.

    **Derivation:** This formula is the complement of the Wright (1931)
    island-model Fst equilibrium. Since Fst = 1/(1+M) (proved at
    `fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium`), the shared fraction is
    1 - Fst = 1 - 1/(1+M) = M/(1+M). See `sharedLD_from_equilibrium_eq`
    and `sharedLD_from_equilibrium_eq_sharedLDFromMigration` for the
    formal algebraic derivation.

    Empirical status: **AN IDENTITY, NOT A MEASUREMENT**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk9.py`). This is the
    algebraic complement of `fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium`, which is separately
    measured, so a battery comparing the two reproduces `M/(1+M) = 1 - 1/(1+M)`
    to machine precision and the harness returns SELF-TEST. The empirical content
    is entirely in the equilibrium it complements -- including that equilibrium's
    recorded deme-count blindness, which this inherits.

    THE NAME IS A SECOND CLAIM, AND IT IS **FALSIFIED**
    (`simcov/battery_bulk34.py`). That `M/(1+M) = 1 - 1/(1+M)` is algebra. That
    the resulting number is the fraction of LD SHARED between demes is not, and
    a simulation reaches it: shared LD read as the cross-deme correlation of
    signed `r` over SNP pairs -- a property of PAIRS of sites, where `F_ST` is a
    property of single sites -- runs 0.9060, 0.9341, 0.9674 and 0.9890 as
    `4·Nₑ·m` goes 0.4, 2, 8, 40, against this body's 0.4394, 0.7921, 0.9290 and
    0.9864. Worst cell 35 sems, low by a factor of two at `F_ST = 0.56`. The
    agreement at `4·Nₑ·m = 40` is the weak-differentiation limit, not the
    general case. See `sharedLD_from_equilibrium` for the full table, the
    rejected variants and the control.

    So the SELF-TEST verdict is right about what `battery_bulk9.py` compared,
    and wrong as a summary of this body's empirical content: the identity is
    unfalsifiable, the interpretation is not, and the interpretation is what
    downstream consumers use. -/

/-! ### 5. Portability under migration-drift: R² improves with gene flow -/

/-- **Signal retention under migration-drift balance.**

The fraction of additive signal that survives, accounting for both allele
frequency drift and LD sharing at the migration-drift equilibrium. It is
`(1 - F_ST) * shared_LD = M²/(1 + M)²` with `M = 4 Nₑ m`, and it lies in
`[0, 1)`.

The previous body of this name multiplied by `V_A` and so returned a variance,
not a fraction: it was unbounded and grew without limit as the additive variance
grew. A retention that scales with an additive variance is not a retention. The
name now denotes the fraction and `retainedSignalVarianceMigrationDrift` denotes
the variance; `retainedSignalVarianceMigrationDrift_eq_retention_mul_VA` relates
them. This corpus has already lost a factor of four to just this kind of
name/quantity mismatch, so the two are separated rather than bounded.

    Denotes: a dimensionless fraction in `[0, 1)`, never a variance.

    Regime: two-deme island model at migration-drift balance; "signal
    retention" read as the fraction of a score's covariance with the genetic
    value that survives transfer from the deme its weights came from.

    Empirical status: UNTESTED, with a LEAD against the product form.
    DOWNGRADED from a falsification after a replication check: a second run of
    the same design (`simcov/battery_bulk36.py`) returned retention 0.736 at
    `4·Nₑ·m = 40` where the first returned 0.993, and 0.614 against 0.781 at
    `4·Nₑ·m = 8`. Those gaps are an order of magnitude larger than the ±0.08
    error bars either run quotes, so the quoted bars understate the true
    variability and no verdict here is safe.

    The instability is in the CALIBRATION, not the biology. Retention is divided
    by the estimator's panmictic ceiling, and that ceiling came out 0.8905 in
    the first run and 1.0430 in the second -- a 17% swing on six replicates,
    applied to every cell. A ceiling above one is itself the tell: attenuation
    can only pull it below one, so the second estimate is noise-dominated. A
    usable design needs the ceiling pinned to a few percent, which means
    hundreds of replicates rather than six, or an estimator that needs no
    calibration at all.

    What both runs agree on qualitatively: measured retention rises with
    migration but stays well below the product form at weak migration. That is
    the lead, and it is consistent with `sharedLD_from_equilibrium`, where
    measured shared LD stayed near 1 rather than falling to `M/(1+M)`.

    The table below is the FIRST run, kept for the record:
    Measured at `Nₑ = 1000` over 5 Mb with
    recombination, 80 causal sites segregating in both demes, weights taken as
    the deme-0 LD projection `Σ_A·β` (itself VALIDATED at
    `targetSourceEffectProjection`):

      4Nₑm    retention          this body   1-F     M/(1+M)
      0.4     0.507 ± 0.076      0.131       0.460   0.286
      2.0     0.523 ± 0.076      0.543       0.814   0.667
      8.0     0.781 ± 0.099      0.834       0.939   0.889
      40      0.993 ± 0.117      0.963       0.987   0.976

    The product misses by 4.97 sems (74% relative), low at weak migration where
    it multiplies two factors that are each already below one. The single
    factor `1 - F` is ALSO falsified, at 3.81 sems. `M/(1+M)` alone survives at
    worst 2.93 sems.

    NOT ASSERTED: that `M/(1+M)` is the right law. Its worst cell is off by 44%
    relative and escapes rejection only by sitting just under the three-sem
    gate, on error bars of 0.08 to 0.12. What this run establishes is that the
    PRODUCT is wrong; which single factor replaces it needs tighter bars. The
    direction is consistent with `sharedLD_from_equilibrium`, where measured
    shared LD stayed near 1 rather than falling to `M/(1+M)` -- if the LD term
    does not decay as written, multiplying by it twice over is the error this
    table shows.

    Calibration, not a control: the estimator attenuates because `w = Σ_A·β`
    reuses the same finite-sample `Σ_A` the denominator contracts against, so
    the denominator carries squared estimation noise the numerator does not. The
    attenuation is measured on one panmictic population split arbitrarily in
    half -- same sample size, same site count, same pipeline -- and divided out
    of every cell. The CONTROL is that the same split gives `F_ST = 0`. -/

/-- **No calibration constant can reconcile the two laws**, which is what makes
the comparison between them survive the defect that stalled it.

Both runs recorded above divided measured retention by an estimator ceiling
obtained from a panmictic control, and that ceiling came out `0.8905` and then
`1.0430` on six replicates -- a 17% swing applied to every cell, which is why
neither run's verdict was safe.  An unstable ceiling is a multiplicative
constant on the measurement.

This theorem says that no such constant maps the single-factor law onto the
product law: they are `x` and `x²`, so a constant `c` would have to equal `x`,
and `x` varies with migration.  A calibration error therefore cannot turn one
into the other, and cannot manufacture agreement with the wrong one either.

The design that follows needs no ceiling at all.  Measure retention and `F_ST`
on the same data and read the slope of `log retention` against `log (1 - F_ST)`:
the product form predicts `2`, the single factor predicts `1`, and an unknown
multiplicative ceiling `c` contributes `log c` to the INTERCEPT and nothing to
the slope.  That is the discriminating comparison this definition has been
missing -- exponent 1 against exponent 2 -- and it is the reason the status
below can stop being a standing debt.

/-! ### 6. Asymmetric migration -/

/-- **Two demes exchanging migrants at two different rates.**

    `1 / (1 + 4 Nₑ (m₁₂ + m₂₁))`: the differentiation between two demes is set by
    the TOTAL rate at which they exchange lineages, and by nothing else. It does
    not depend on the direction, and there is no such thing as "`F_ST` from
    population 1's perspective" -- `F_ST` is a property of the pair.

    **Both the signature and the body have been corrected, and the claim the old
    ones made was excluded by measurement.** The definition read
    `asymmetricFst (Ne m_into) = 1 / (1 + 4 Nₑ m_into)`: one rate, named as the
    rate INTO the focal deme, with two theorems below asserting that the answer
    moves when the direction is swapped. Two things were wrong with it at once.
    It could not say which of the two rates `m_into` was, and at `m₁₂ = m₂₁`,
    where that ambiguity does not arise, it still returned the many-deme limit
    `1/(1 + 4 Nₑ m)` for a system its own name commits to exactly two demes.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED after correction; the superseded body
    FALSIFIED at up to 80 sems**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_dis2.py`). Two demes,
    `Ne = 1000`, `F_ST` read as `1 - E[T_within]/E[T_between]` from branch
    lengths so no estimator convention enters, 24 replicates of 4 Mb. Six
    designs: the total rate spans a factor of four, and three of them share a
    total while differing in asymmetry, so a law that depended on more than the
    total would separate:

      m12      m21      larger    smaller   this body   measured
      5.0e-4   5.0e-4   0.33333   0.33333   0.20000     0.22086 ± 0.01028

      3.5e-3   5.0e-4   0.06667   0.33333   0.05882     0.05717 ± 0.00383

    This body's worst cell is 2.03 sems. The two readings of the old single
    argument are excluded at 16.2 and 79.9 sems, and neither failure is a
    constant: the smaller-rate reading is wrong by a factor of five at the most
    asymmetric design and right to within a factor of two at the least, which is
    what an underspecified signature looks like from the outside.

    Note which rows carry the finding. The three symmetric rows alone would only
    have shown the missing deme-count factor of two. The three rows sharing a
    total of `2.0e-3` while running from mild to strong asymmetry are what
    excludes any direction dependence: they agree with each other to 1.4 sems
    while the two directional readings differ from each other by a factor of
    four and a half across them.

    The positive control is the symmetric cell at `m = 1.0e-3` against the
    two-deme island value `1/(1 + 2 · 4 Nₑ m)`, validated independently in
    `battery_correct.py`, and it passes at 1.93 sems.

    Superseded, and recorded because it was believed: **FALSIFIED**, by the same
    mechanism as
    `PopulationGeneticsFoundations.fstMigrationMutationEquilibriumManyDemes`: the
    deme-count factor is missing (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk13.py`).
    Two demes with asymmetric migration, `Ne = 1000`, `F_ST` read as
    `1 - E[T_within]/E[T_between]` from coalescence times so no estimator
    convention enters, 26 replicates of 4 Mb:

      m12       m21      larger-rate reading   smaller-rate   measured
      1.0e-3    1.0e-3     0.20000 (14.5σ)     0.20000 (14.5σ)  0.11480±0.00589
      1.5e-3    5.0e-4     0.14286 ( 4.3σ)     0.33333 (34.1σ)  0.11538±0.00640
      1.8e-3    2.0e-4     0.12195 ( 2.4σ)     0.55556 (85.6σ)  0.10918±0.00521

    NEITHER reading of the single `m_into` argument works, and the SYMMETRIC row
    says why. There `m12 = m21`, so there is no ambiguity about which rate to
    use, and the body still misses by 14.5 sems: it returns
    `1/(1 + 4 Ne m) = 0.200` where the two-deme value is
    `1/(1 + 2 · 4 Ne m) = 0.111`. The factor of two is `islandDemeCorrection` at
    `n = 2`, which two independent designs in this branch have now confirmed.

    So this is not an asymmetry problem at all. It is the deme-count blindness
    already recorded on `fstMigrationMutationEquilibriumManyDemes`, in a definition whose
    name commits it to exactly two demes and which therefore cannot plead the
    many-deme limit. Use `fstIslandEquilibriumFiniteDemes` with `nDemes = 2`.

    The positive control is the symmetric cell against the independently
    validated two-deme island value, and it passes at 0.77 sems, so the design
    reproduces a known answer before reporting a new one -- which the forward
    Wright-Fisher attempt at this same pair in `battery_bulk1.py` did not, and
    was correctly voided for.

    Power: the prediction spans 0.05882 to 0.20000 across the design, a factor
    of three and a half. -/

/-- **Arithmetic mean of the two directional migration rates.**

    **The docstring here said "harmonic mean" and the body is the arithmetic mean.** They
    are different numbers whenever the two rates differ, and the disagreement is
    one-sided: AM ≥ HM always, with equality only at `m₁₂ = m₂₁`
    (`harmonicMigrationMean_le_effectiveSymmetricMigration` below). So the stated
    quantity systematically *overstates* gene flow relative to the quantity the docstring
    named.

    That error does not stop at the mean. `fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium` is decreasing in
    the migration rate, so an overstated rate yields an understated `F_ST`, which
    `presentDayR2` turns into an *overstated* `R²` in the target population — the
    optimistic direction, and the direction that matters for a user being told how well a
    score transfers. `effectiveSymmetricMigration_fst_le_harmonic_fst` states that
    consequence.

    This is the same failure shape the corpus already records for `hudsonFst` computing
    Nei's `G_ST`: a name and docstring asserting one estimator over a body computing
    another, with the discrepancy landing in the direction that flatters the result. The
    name and docstring are corrected here rather than the body, because the body is what
    two other files already depend on — `Conventions.lean` ties it to `meanAlleleFreq`
    (an arithmetic mean, so that identity is only true of the current body), and
    `PopulationGeneticsFoundations.lean` proves the betweenness and idempotence facts
    against it. Changing the body to a harmonic mean would falsify both. Which of the two
    means is the right effective rate for asymmetric migration is not settled anywhere in
    this corpus, and nothing here should be read as settling it.
    nothing about the harmonic mean.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED as a constancy claim**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk13.py`). The claim is that
    an asymmetric pair behaves like a symmetric one at the ARITHMETIC MEAN rate,
    so the test holds that mean fixed and varies the asymmetry: if anything
    beyond the mean mattered, the measured `F_ST` would move and the prediction
    would not.

    The asymmetry ratio runs from 1 to 9 across those rows and the measurement
    moves by 0.006, within its own error. The prediction is constant BY
    CONSTRUCTION here, which is why the verdict machinery reports no span; the
    power of this design is in the measured values not moving, not in the
    predicted ones moving.

/-! ### 7. Recent migration (admixture): transient LD from migration pulses -/

/-- **Admixture LD from a recent migration pulse.**
    A pulse of migration (admixture) at time t_adm generations ago creates
    LD between loci at recombination distance r. This LD decays as:
    D_adm(t) = D_0 × (1 - r)^(t - t_adm)
    where D_0 is the initial admixture LD and t is the current time.
    We model the decay factor.

    **REGIME: infinite population.** `(1-r)` is the recombination-only
    retention, i.e. the `Nₑ → ∞` limit, and nothing in the expression says so
    -- there is no `Nₑ` argument for it to say it with. The finite-population
    retention is `(1-r)(1 - 1/(2Nₑ))`, which is
    `LDDecayTheory.ldRetentionPerGen` and is measured accurate to within
    `0.12%`. This body is high by exactly the omitted drift factor: measured
    `+0.24%` to `+0.37%` over the tested range. The bias is therefore small but
    STRICTLY ONE-SIDED, and `admixtureLDDecay_ge_finitePopulation` below proves
    that direction rather than leaving it to the runs that happened to be done;
    it also grows with `generations_since`, since the omitted factor is
    compounded.

    Small and one-sided is the combination worth naming: it will not show up as
    noise in a comparison, and it accumulates in the same direction over time.

    Empirical status: VALIDATED as the `Nₑ → ∞` limit; MEASURED high by
    `+0.24%` to `+0.37%` against the finite-population retention. The sibling
    quantities `LDDecayTheory.admixtureLD` and
    `CovarianceStructure.admixtureLDTwoLocus` are EXACT to `2.8e-17` and need
    nothing.

    Power: the comparison in
    `validation/empirical/differential/cluster/fam_admixture.py` runs the
    per-generation retention at `r = 0, 0.0025, 0.02, 0.1, 0.5` with `Ne = 200`,
    where this body predicts `1.000000`, `0.997500`, `0.980000`, `0.900000` and
    `0.500000` against measured `0.997575`, `0.994828`, `0.977596`, `0.896658`
    and `0.506154`. The grid straddles `1/(2Ne)`, so the drift factor is visible
    rather than swamped, and the prediction covers half the unit interval. -/
noncomputable def admixtureLDDecay (r : ℝ) (generations_since : ℕ) : ℝ :=
  (1 - r) ^ generations_since

/-- **The omission is one-sided: this body is never below the finite-population
    retention.** The finite-`Nₑ` retention per generation is
    `(1-r)(1 - 1/(2Nₑ))`, compounded over `generations_since`; dropping the
    drift factor can only raise the result, at every `r`, every `Nₑ` and every
    number of generations. That is why every measured error is positive
    (`+0.24%` to `+0.37%`) rather than scattered about zero, and it is a
    property of the omission rather than of the parameters that were simulated.

    The finite-population factor is written out here instead of being called by
    name because `LDDecayTheory.ldRetentionPerGen`, which is that expression,
    lives in a module that imports this one; the two are the same quantity. -/

/-! ## Migration-Drift Recurrence: Deriving Fst = 1/(1 + 4Nm) from First Principles

We derive the classical Wright (1931) equilibrium Fst formula from the
migration-drift recurrence relation. The island model with migration rate m
and effective population size Ne yields a linear recurrence on Fst:

  Fst_{t+1} = (1 - 2m - 1/(2Ne)) * Fst_t + 1/(2Ne)

This is the linearized form where (1-m)² ≈ 1 - 2m. At equilibrium
Fst* = Fst_{t+1} = Fst_t, solving the linear equation gives:

  Fst* = 1 / (4*Ne*m + 1)

We prove this closed form satisfies the recurrence, then derive monotonicity
and portability consequences directly from the recurrence structure.

/-! ### 1. The migration-drift recurrence -/

/-- **Migration-drift recurrence on Fst.**
    In the island model with migration rate `m` and effective size `Ne`,
    the linearized one-generation update of Fst is:
      Fst_{t+1} = (1 - 2m - 1/(2Ne)) * Fst_t + 1/(2Ne)
    Migration reduces Fst by a factor (1-2m), and drift adds (1-Fst)/(2Ne).
    The linearization replaces (1-m)² with 1-2m (valid for small m).

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk1.py`,
    `test_one_step_maps`). Same trajectories, same one-step protocol, as
    `ibdRecurrenceStep`:

    This and `ibdRecurrenceStep` are two different functions and the corpus
    relates them by no theorem, which is the unresolved-fork pattern. As
    one-step maps they agree to within 0.07 sems on every design tested here, so
    the fork is real in the algebra and immaterial at these rates; it would take
    a design at large `m` to separate them.

/-! ### The migration-drift equilibrium, under one name

`fstMigDriftEquil Ne m = 1 / (4 * Ne * m + 1)` stood here as a third spelling of
`fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium Ne m = 1 / (1 + 4 * Ne * m)`, with its own junk-point
theorem, its own positivity, its own two bounds and its own two monotonicities -- eight
declarations, each the twin of one above, and a ninth proving the two spellings equal.

The prose here said so: "Three definitions of one quantity share a junk branch, so
agreement between them is not evidence about the value." The remedy for that is one
definition, not a theorem tying the copies, because a tie makes the copies consistent and
leaves the reader to find out which of the three names a given theorem happens to use.

which is the reading that makes the balance explicit -- is stated below on the surviving
name. -/

/-! ## Nonreversible gene flow: the mixing time is not the transfer time

Everything above this point models divergence with reversible machinery — drift, symmetric
migration, coalescent times. Real gene flow is not reversible: expansions, admixture pulses and
sex-biased migration carry probability around cycles. `Calibrator.CirculationDefect` separates
what that changes from what it does not.

It does not change the degradation calculus: the Dirichlet energy annihilates the circulation, so
every ordering of weighting schemes by that energy survives unchanged.

It does change what a measured mixing time means. Circulation accelerates ergodic averaging
without contributing to the frontier, so the diagnostic reports a shorter time than the one
governing transfer — at equal circulation and dissipation, half of it.

That is a third mechanism alongside the two this file carries. Allele-frequency divergence says
how far apart populations are, tagging mismatch says how much linkage structure carries over, and
this says a well-mixed-looking population can still be a bad transfer target because the rate at
which its environment forgets is not the rate at which a design degrades. -/

section NonreversibleFlow

/-- A mixing-time diagnostic understates the transfer-relevant time. Instance of
    `apparentMixingTime_lt_frontierTime`: with any cyclic component to gene flow, the time
    constant an ergodic-averaging diagnostic measures is strictly shorter than the one setting the
