/-! ### The ploidy-scaled rates, and the identity fraction they feed

`θ = 4 Nₑ μ` and `M = 4 Nₑ m` are the same scaling applied to a mutation rate and to a
migration rate, and `1 / (1 + θ)` is the identity fraction at either. Six accessors across
five structures — `SplitMigrationModel`, `GenerationalPopGenParameters`,
`MutationDriftModelAssumptions`, `EvolutionaryParameters` and `PGSEvolutionaryModel` —
used to spell out their own `4 * Ne * _`, and two more wrote out the quotient. That is
eight independent chances to write a different four.

They sit at the top of this module because that is the lowest point every user can see.
The copies existed for a structural reason rather than by oversight: `scaledMutationRate`
and `fstMutationDriftEquilibrium` lived in `PopulationGeneticsFoundations` and
`scaledMigrationRate` in `PortabilityDrift`, each of which *imports* the modules whose
definitions were computing them. A definition that cannot reach the function it is
computing will be written out again, so placing these correctly is what removes the
duplication rather than merely forbidding it.

Moving definitions like these has now broken this module three times, never in the
mathematics and always in sites that *name* a definition without *applying* it —
`unfold` lists and docstrings. Search this file for "Note for anyone editing the Fst
cluster" for the two failure shapes and the rule they share, recorded next to
`fstEquilibrium` where they landed. -/

/-- **Scaled mutation rate** `θ = 4 Nₑ μ`, the fundamental parameter of neutral theory.

    Regime: neutral, single panmictic population, infinite alleles.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED** (`simcov/battery_bulk19.py`). A scaling
    cannot be measured on its own, so it is read through the infinite-alleles
    equilibrium heterozygosity `θ/(1+θ)`, which is separately validated at
    `PortabilityDrift.hetMutationFloor`. The body predicts 0.50000, 0.50000,
    0.20000 and 0.20000 against measured 0.53297 ± 0.01697, 0.46858 ± 0.01307,
    0.20081 ± 0.00688 and 0.21293 ± 0.00801 -- worst cell 2.40 sems.

    Power: `Nₑ` and `μ` are swept by a factor of four INDEPENDENTLY, so two
    cells reach `θ = 1` and two reach `θ = 4` by different routes. A wrong
    numeric factor and a wrong `Nₑ`-dependence each break one of those pairs,
    which a sweep holding `4·Nₑ·μ` fixed could not detect at all. -/

the whole content of the scaling convention. -/

/-- **Scaled migration rate** `M = 4 Nₑ m`, the same scaling applied to gene flow.

    Regime: two-deme island model, `m` the total emigration rate.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED** (`simcov/battery_bulk19.py`). Read through
    the two-deme island `F_ST` from coalescence times against `1/(1 + 2·M)`,
    where the factor two is `islandDemeCorrection` at `n = 2` -- the deme count
    matters and a deme-blind law would be off by it. The body predicts 0.33333,
    0.33333, 0.11111 and 0.11111 against measured 0.31967 ± 0.01809, 0.30661 ±
    0.01138, 0.10482 ± 0.00611 and 0.10891 ± 0.00467, worst cell 2.35 sems.

    Power: as for `scaledMutationRate`, `Nₑ` and `m` are swept by a factor of
    four INDEPENDENTLY, so `M = 1` and `M = 4` are each reached twice by
    different routes and the `Nₑ`-dependence is separately on trial. -/
noncomputable def scaledMigrationRate (Ne m : ℝ) : ℝ :=

/-- **The scaling factor is four times the effective size**, the same convention as the scaled
mutation rate. Dividing by the migration rate exhibits it, which is the whole content of the
convention and is what a body carrying any other multiple would fail while remaining positive and
increasing in both arguments. -/

  field_simp

/-- **Identity fraction at a scaled rate**, `1 / (1 + θ)`.

Not stipulated: `PopulationGeneticsFoundations.fstMutationDriftEquilibrium_isFixedPoint`
derives it as the rest point of `scaledIdentityStep` at scaled rate `θ`. That theorem lives
in another module, so a guard looking for a fixed-point result beside the definition will
not find it.

    Regime: infinite alleles, single panmictic population at mutation-drift
    equilibrium. The quantity is the probability that two alleles drawn at
    random are IDENTICAL BY STATE -- the complement of heterozygosity, not a
    between-population differentiation despite the `fst` in the name.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED** (`simcov/battery_bulk19.py`, and
    independently `battery_bulk20b.py` on its complement). Measured against
    `msprime`'s `InfiniteAlleles` model: the body predicts 0.50000, 0.50000,
    0.20000 and 0.20000 at `θ = 1, 1, 4, 4` against measured 0.53297 ± 0.01697,
    0.46858 ± 0.01307, 0.20081 ± 0.00688 and 0.21293 ± 0.00801 -- worst cell
    2.40 sems.

    Power: `Nₑ` and `μ` are swept by a factor of four INDEPENDENTLY, so each
    `θ` is reached twice by different routes and a wrong `Nₑ`-dependence breaks
    one of the pair. Corroboration: `PortabilityDrift.hetMutationFloor` is the
    complement `θ/(1+θ)` and was measured on a separate run over `θ` = 0.1 to
    10 -- a hundredfold sweep -- at worst 2.17 sems, with an Ewens
    expected-allele-count control passing at 1.10 sems. Two runs, two
    complementary observables, one law. -/

Two accessors on two structures used to write this product out separately.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED as a linearisation**, with the
    gap stated (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_max.py`,
    `test_het_recurrences`). Against one Wright-Fisher generation with two-way
    allele mutation, predicted from the measured heterozygosity of the preceding
    generation:

      Ne     theta    this def   simulated            relative

    Low in every cell and growing with `theta`: the product `(1 - 1/(2Ne))
    (1 - theta/(2Ne))` drops the input term that `hetStepWithMutation` carries,
    so it is a pure-decay reading and understates the retained heterozygosity
    wherever mutation replenishes it. One and a half percent per generation at
    `theta = 2` compounds over a run. -/

multiplying them would fail this, and would also predict decay exceeding one for large `θ`. -/

/-- **The per-generation decay factor of a DIFFERENTIATION transient**, as
distinct from a heterozygosity one: `hetDecayFromScaled Nₑ θ · (1 - M/(2 Nₑ))`,
a third channel multiplied onto the same two.

`hetDecayFromScaled` is the decay of within-deme heterozygosity, and migration
does not appear in it because migration does not destroy heterozygosity -- it
moves it between demes. `F_ST` is a between-deme quantity, and migration is the
force that removes between-deme differentiation, so it enters this factor and
not that one. The two are different processes with different rates and the
corpus previously used the first for both.

**This exists because `fstTransientAt` and `PGSEvolutionaryModel.fstTransient`
used `hetDecayFromScaled` as their decay base.** Doing so made them approach an
equilibrium set by three forces at a rate set by two, which is not a possible
process: a system whose plateau moves when you change `M` cannot reach that
plateau at a rate that does not.

Empirical status: **VALIDATED** (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_dis4.py`).
24-deme forward Wright-Fisher island model, no mutation so no mutation-model
convention enters, started identical; the tested quantity is the HALF-LIFE of
`F(t)` against its own plateau, a property of the shape, so no `F_ST` convention
enters either:

  Ne    M      superseded base   this base   measured
   50   0.0       69.3             69.3      70.67 ± 0.49
  100   2.0      138.6             46.2      46.88 ± 0.40
  200   6.0      277.3             39.6      39.51 ± 0.39
  400   16.0     554.5             32.6      33.02 ± 0.23

Worst cell here is 2.77 sems and 2 percent, at the `M = 0` design where the two
bases agree. The superseded base is wrong by a factor of seventeen at
`M = 16` -- 2222 sems -- and the design sweeps `Ne` alongside `M` so that both
candidates predict a moving half-life rather than one of them predicting a
constant.

The positive control is the `M = 0` cell against the exact deterministic
two-moment recursion for this model, run through the identical half-life
estimator, and it passes at 0.88 sems. That control is what makes the verdict
usable: the estimator has a two percent bias of its own at `M = 0`, where the
island model's two eigenvalues are closest and a single fitted exponential picks
up a little of the slow one, and charging that bias to the definition rather
than to the instrument is what an earlier run of this design did.

Denotes: a per-generation retention factor for a BETWEEN-population quantity.
Other definitions share the shape of this formula under names from the
heterozygosity family; the formula does not fix which is meant, and the whole
content of this one is that the two families take different forces. -/

/-! **The two interval-membership theorems below are `Set.Icc` membership, and nothing in
them is certified.**

`scoreApproximationError` is `berryEsseenErrorBound`, which is the *formula* `C·ρ₃/σ³`
written down as a definition — no Berry-Esseen theorem is invoked from Mathlib or proved
here, and `berryEsseenConstant` is a free field of `HWEPolygenicScoreDGP` rather than a
constant any bound supplies.  Even granting the formula, a Kolmogorov bound on the
standardized *score CDF* is not a bound on AUC or on `R²`: each is a further functional of
that CDF and transferring the radius across is a separate estimate this corpus does not
have.  That transfer is exactly what enters below as the hypothesis `h`.

So what these prove is `mem_approximationInterval_of_abs_sub_le` — `|x - c| ≤ ε → x ∈
[c-ε, c+ε]` — with `ε` instantiated at a named quantity.  They are kept because the
interval interface is used downstream, and stated so that the assumed step is visible in
the hypothesis rather than implied by the word "certified".  Note also that
`approximationInterval` is used for both AUC and `R²` below; the two aliases that used to
distinguish them were the *same* function
`approximationInterval` under two names, so nothing in either statement would detect
swapping AUC for `R²`. -/

/-- Any exact quantity within `scoreApproximationError` of a Gaussian center lies in the
corresponding interval around that center.  The error control is the hypothesis.

There were two of these, one named for AUC and one for `R²`.  Since `approximationInterval`
is the same function in both, the two statements were the same proposition with the variables
renamed -- neither could detect swapping AUC for `R²`, which is the very confusion the
paragraph above warns about, committed in the names of the theorems warning about it. -/

/-! ### Tagged DGP (Causal vs Observable Architecture)

This block explicitly separates:
- latent causal variants `X_causal`
- observed/tag variants `X_tag`

and defines LD as the causal-tag correlation matrix under a joint law on `(X_causal, X_tag)`.

structure TaggedDataGeneratingProcess (c t : ℕ) where
  trueExpectation : CausalVec c → TagVec t → ℝ
  jointMeasureCT : Measure (CausalVec c × TagVec t)

/-- **The tagged process class is inhabited.** Every result in this section is
universally quantified over a `TaggedDataGeneratingProcess`, and the structure
imposes no probability constraint on `jointMeasureCT`, so nothing in the type
forces a model to exist; this exhibits one.

The joint law is a point mass rather than the ZERO measure, and the difference
matters more than it looks. The structure imposes no probability constraint, so
`jointMeasureCT := 0` would also typecheck and would also inhabit the class --
but every integral against it vanishes for the trivial reason that there is no
mass, which makes the three `_at_zero_law` theorems below indistinguishable from
statements about a genuine law. A Dirac measure is a real probability measure
(`TaggedDataGeneratingProcess.witness_isProbabilityMeasure`), so the class now
contains an actual data-generating process.

WHAT THIS STILL DOES NOT ESTABLISH: a point mass has no spread, so its
causal-tag cross-covariance is zero for a second, different reason. A witness
with NONZERO `crossCovEntry` -- which is what would make the tagging results
statements about tagging rather than about a degenerate law -- needs a
constructed non-atomic measure on the product space and is not supplied here. -/

/-! ### Step 4: Demography (`F_ST`) → Covariance Divergence (with tagging density)

This block introduces a demographic lower bound connecting divergence to covariance-matrix
mismatch in observable tag space. It includes an explicit recombination/array sparsity factor:
- if tagging is effectively perfect (`arraySparsity = 0`), bound collapses to `0`;
- for sparse arrays (`arraySparsity > 0`), mismatch grows with divergence `fstTarget - fstSource`.

/-- Demography-to-LD lower bound template used in portability theorems.

**Vacuous in the generic split, and this is measured, not suspected.** The bound is
proportional to `fstTarget - fstSource`, so it is identically zero whenever the two
populations are equally diverged from a common ancestor — which is the ordinary case and
the one ancestry-specific LD results are about. Over simulated configurations of that
kind the squared Frobenius LD mismatch it is supposed to bound ranged from 2.554 to
7.346 while the bound sat at zero.

It is also never *proved* anywhere: it appears only as a hypothesis
(`covariance_mismatch_pos_of_fst_and_sparse_array`, `target_r2_drop_of_fst_and_sparse_array`),
so those two theorems rest on a quantity that vanishes exactly where they would be
applied. Step 4b below is the non-vacuous replacement and does not read this definition. -/

    already carried elsewhere, and no measurement of the matrix itself is
    claimed or needed. The one entry with observable content is the linked pair,
    which is `twoLocusIBDCovariance = ibdWeight * discreteRecombinationSurvival`;
    the survival factor is VALIDATED above at 400000 replicate meiosis chains
    across a sixfold span of predictions, and `ibdWeight` is a free scale that
    any measurement would fit rather than test. The remaining structure -- unit
    diagonal, zeros off the linked pair -- is what "generated by a SINGLE

/-! ### Step 4b: the same conclusion without an `F_ST` difference

**The defect in Step 4, measured rather than suspected.**
`demographicCovarianceGapLowerBound` is `kappa * recombRate * arraySparsity *
(fstTarget - fstSource)`. It reads the *difference* of two divergences. For two
populations that split from one ancestor and drifted equally — the generic split, and
exactly the configuration ancestry-specific LD results are about — `fstSource =
fstTarget`, so the bound is identically zero and the hypothesis `h_fst : fstSource <
fstTarget` of both theorems above is **false**. Over simulated configurations of that
kind the squared Frobenius LD mismatch ranged from 2.554 to 7.346 while this bound sat
at zero. The two theorems are true and inapplicable in the case that matters: they can
certify a portability drop only when one population is *more* diverged than the other,
which is not what equal drift from a shared ancestor produces.

**What replaces it.** The missing ingredient is a positivity certificate that reads the
correlation structure rather than a divergence difference.
`Calibrator.SpectralDegradation.FiniteSpectralModel.degradation_eq_zero_iff` is exactly
that: transport costs nothing **if and only if** the source and target optimal readouts
`c/sigma` agree in every frequency band. So a single band of readout disagreement forces
strictly positive excess target risk, with no reference to `F_ST`, to array sparsity, or
to any recombination scale — and in particular the certificate is available at
`fstSource = fstTarget`, where Step 4 has nothing to say.

Note precisely what has and has not been transferred. Step 4 bounds
`frobeniusNormSq (sigmaSource - sigmaTarget)`, a distance between covariance matrices,
and then converts it to risk through the *assumed* inequality `h_mse_gap_lb`. Step 4b
does not need that assumed conversion, because `degradation` is already defined as excess
target risk: `risk target (optimalReadout source) - risk target (optimalReadout target)`.
The price is that the object is a finite band model rather than a covariance matrix, so
this is not a strengthening of Step 4 in Step 4's own coordinates — it is a different and
non-vacuous route to the same biological conclusion.
-/

/-- **Excess target risk is strictly positive as soon as one band's optimal readout
disagrees** — no `F_ST` difference, no tagging scale, no sparsity.

This is the equal-divergence replacement for `covariance_mismatch_pos_of_fst_and_sparse_array`.
It is not provable in this file: its content is
`FiniteSpectralModel.degradation_eq_zero_iff`, whose proof is the bandwise sum identity
`degradation = sum_b (readout gap)^2 * targetSpectrum`, and nothing in the demographic
machinery here produces it. -/

/-- **End-to-end `R²` drop from a single band of readout mismatch.**

The Step 4 conclusion — `R²_target < R²_source` — reached with the `F_ST`-difference
hypothesis deleted rather than assumed. The comparison is between the transported
source-optimal readout and the refitted target-optimal readout, both evaluated on the
target, which is the transfer comparison a deployment actually makes.

Deleting `Calibrator.SpectralDegradation` breaks this theorem:
`excess_target_risk_pos_of_bandwise_readout_mismatch`
is its only source of strict positivity, and that in turn is
`degradation_eq_zero_iff`. -/

/-! ### Generalized Population Structure (No Admixture Assumption)

We model population structure via an ancestry-indexed LD environment Σ(C),
and decompose genetic variance into genic (diagonal) and covariance (off-diagonal)
components. This captures admixture, divergence, and drift uniformly. -/

structure GeneticArchitecture (k : ℕ) where
  /-- Genic variance (as if loci were independent). -/

The field `selection_effect` carries a sign convention in its docstring --
positive divergent, negative stabilizing -- and until this definition existed
that convention was prose that nothing could contradict: `totalVariance` is the
sum of the other two fields, so every theorem about an architecture was blind to
selection and the field was carried without being read. The convention IS this
displacement, so it is written as one, and the three theorems below are the
convention restated where a proof can check it.

    Regime: an ancestry-indexed LD environment at fixed allele frequencies, with
    selection entering as an additive displacement of the between-population
    variance rather than through a change in the frequencies themselves. That is
    what makes it a decomposition and not a dynamic: a model in which selection
    moved the frequencies would move `V_genic` too, and the displacement could
    not be read off separately.

    Empirical status: NOT AN EMPIRICAL CLAIM -- a definitional decomposition of
    the architecture's own fields. What could be measured is the modelling claim
    that a selection regime is summarised by a single additive displacement, and
    that belongs at whatever supplies the displacement, not here. -/

Under the *linear noise model* `optimalSlopeLinearNoise`, and only under it, the optimal slope
is a reciprocal function of `c` and so is matched by no affine function.  The name
`ld_decay_implies_nonlinear_calibration` is absent here on purpose: it asserts LD decay as
the mechanism, and neither LD, distance nor decay appears in the statement, which is a
hypothesis-weakening
wrapper for `linear_noise_implies_nonlinear_slope` with the positivity side conditions
discharged from nonnegativity.  The LD-decay statement that *is* proved is
`Calibrator.ld_decay_implies_nonlinear_calibration_of_exp_tagging` in the corpus root, which
supplies
three explicit distances through an `LDDecayMechanism`. -/

The score drifts with ancestry while true liability does not.
The calibrator must subtract the drift term (PC main effects). -/


/-! ### Normalization-Prevalence Bias (Cross-Ancestry Calibration)

**Key Insight**: When a PGS is normalized (mean-centered across ancestries) and then
calibrated to produce risk predictions, the normalization step implicitly assumes equal
disease prevalence across ancestry groups. If prevalences actually differ, the calibrated
predictions are biased toward the prevalence of the majority training population.

**Mathematical formulation**: Consider ancestry groups indexed by c ∈ Fin k → ℝ with
ancestry-specific disease prevalence π(c). Normalization forces E[score | c] = constant
for all c, but the true conditional risk E[Y | P, C=c] depends on π(c). The residual
bias after normalization is exactly (π(c) - π̄), where π̄ is the population-average
prevalence (weighted by the training distribution).

This section formalizes the claim that normalization *cannot* recover ancestry-specific
prevalence even with perfect PGS, because the prevalence information is projected out
by the mean-centering step. -/

/-- Ancestry-specific prevalence model: the true risk depends on both the PGS
    and the ancestry-specific baseline disease prevalence. -/
structure PrevalenceDGP (k : ℕ) where
  /-- Ancestry-specific baseline prevalence (probability scale). -/

  /-- PGS effect (log-odds-ratio per unit PGS, ancestry-invariant). -/

  prevalence := fun _ ↦ 0
  pgs_effect := 0
  jointMeasure := Measure.dirac 0

/-- True conditional risk under a prevalence DGP (identity link, additive form).
    E[Y | P, C] = π(C) + β · P, where π varies by ancestry and β is shared.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED** (`simcov/battery_bulk47.py`, `group_b`).
    3×10⁶ binary outcomes drawn at the stated conditional rate; the observable
    is the realised mean. Worst cell 0.59 sems at 0.10% relative.

    Power: the MULTIPLICATIVE reading `π·(1 + β·P)` -- the other obvious way to
    let a score shift a prevalence -- is FALSIFIED at 760 sems (76% relative).
    The two coincide at `P = 0`, so the design sweeps `P` away from zero, and
    one cell gives `β` a NEGATIVE sign where the two readings move the
    prevalence in different directions. Control: at `P = 0` the realised rate
    recovers `π(C)`.

    That the shift is ADDITIVE in the score is what makes this an
    observed-scale statement: a multiplicative shift would keep the outcome
    positive automatically, while this body can leave the admissible range and
    the caller must keep it in. -/

/-- **Normalization-Prevalence Bias Theorem**:

    If the true risk is E[Y|P,C] = π(C) + β·P where π varies by ancestry, but a
    normalized predictor uses a single intercept π̄ (population-average prevalence),
    then the prediction error at ancestry C is exactly (π(C) - π̄).

    In other words, normalization "bakes in" the assumption of equal prevalence.
    The calibrated predictions will be systematically:
    - Too high for ancestry groups with π(C) < π̄ (over-prediction)
    - Too low for ancestry groups with π(C) > π̄ (under-prediction)

    This is the mathematical basis for why mean-centering PGS across ancestries
    produces biased risk estimates when disease prevalences differ.

    **Both former hypotheses are gone, and the statement is stronger for it.**
    `_h_pi_bar` pinned `π̄` to the training-distribution average of `π`; it was
    already dead (note the underscore) and the identity holds for *any* centering
    constant, which is the sharper reading — no choice of single intercept
    escapes the residual `π(C) - π̄`.  `f_norm` plus `h_norm` was a free function
    together with an equation defining it pointwise; since `h_norm` determines
    `f_norm` at every argument, quantifying over such an `f_norm` says exactly
    what naming the predictor inline says, while making the caller supply the
    definition. -/

/-! ### Biological → Statistical Bridges

These structures connect biological mechanisms to statistical DGPs and to the
need for nonlinear calibration. The consequence for calibration is proved in
`Calibrator.ld_decay_implies_nonlinear_calibration_of_exp_tagging`, which exhibits three
explicit distances rather than assuming non-affineness as a hypothesis.

**THIS CITATION IS LOAD-BEARING AND IT CROSSES A DIRECTORY BOUNDARY.** The consumer named
above lives in `proofs/Calibrator.lean` -- the corpus ROOT, one level *above*
`proofs/Calibrator/`. A dead-code scan that walks only `proofs/Calibrator/` cannot see it,
and on 2026-02 exactly that happened: `decaySlope` was deleted as having "no use anywhere
and no theorem about them", and `LDDecayMechanism` was then deleted as having "lost its
only consumer". Both premises were false and the second inherited the first's error.

The deletion did NOT break the build, which is the part to remember. Lean auto-binds an
undefined bare name as an implicit variable, so the consuming theorem kept elaborating --
as a vacuous statement over an arbitrary term of unknown type -- and stayed green. For
this class of name the build cannot detect the breakage at all, so **absence of a build
failure is not evidence that a deletion was safe.** Grep the prose, not just the
identifier: this paragraph named the consumer the whole time. -/

/-- Exponential LD-decay mechanism: a distance proxy and a tagging efficiency.

**DO NOT DELETE AS UNUSED.** Its consumer is
`Calibrator.ld_decay_implies_nonlinear_calibration_of_exp_tagging`, which lives in
`proofs/Calibrator.lean` — the corpus ROOT, one directory *above* `proofs/Calibrator/`.
A dead-code scan that walks only `proofs/Calibrator/` reports this and `decaySlope` as
having no consumer, because the root file is outside that directory. Deleting them does
not break the build either, because Lean **auto-binds the now-undefined names as implicit
variables**, so the consuming theorem keeps elaborating as a vacuous statement about an
arbitrary term until an application finally forces the error. Absence of a build failure
is therefore not evidence that a deletion here is safe. -/

efficiency `ρ²(d) = e^{-d}`, the law whose non-affineness in the distance is what
`ld_decay_implies_nonlinear_calibration_of_exp_tagging` in the corpus root turns
into a nonlinear calibration curve.

`LDDecayMechanism` had no exhibited inhabitant, so that root theorem and
`decaySlope_at_zero_efficiency` were quantified over a class nothing had been
shown to belong to. Carrying the distance proxy as a parameter rather than
fixing it keeps the mechanism's two fields independent: the decay law is the
modelling claim, the distance is the study's own PC geometry, and a witness that
fixed both would tie a general statement to one design.

    Regime: tagging efficiency depending on genetic distance alone, with the
    distance measured in whatever units the proxy supplies. The exponential is
    the mechanism this corpus's nonlinearity result assumes, not one derived
    here.

The `tagging_efficiency` field of `LDDecayMechanism` is documented as "decreases
with distance", but the structure takes an arbitrary `ℝ → ℝ` there, so nothing in
the type enforces it and a mechanism whose efficiency INCREASES with distance is
equally well-typed. That sentence was therefore prose about a field, not a
property of one. Here it is a theorem, on the family the corpus's own nonlinearity
result is about.

The positivity of the rate is what carries it: at `rate = 0` the efficiency is
constant, which is the no-decay regime, and at a negative rate it would increase.
Biologically the rate is the reciprocal of the LD decay length, so `0 < rate` is
the statement that tags and causal variants decouple at all. -/

/-! ### Reading a data-generating process at the second-moment level

Almost every closed form in this development is a function of three numbers: the variance
of the signal, the variance of the outcome, and their covariance. Those numbers are
*stipulated* wherever the closed forms are used — `V_A`, `V_E` and `fst` arrive as bare
reals — and nothing connects them to a probability measure. That is why an algebraic
identity between them can be proved without establishing anything about a data-generating
process.

A former `MomentReading` structure stored these equalities as fields.  That made the caller
supply the very bridge being advertised.  The quantities below are now definitions of the
process moments themselves. -/

section MomentReadings

/-- Variance of a predictor under a concrete DGP. -/
noncomputable def signalVariance {k : ℕ} [Fintype (Fin k)]
    (dgp : DataGeneratingProcess k) (signal : Predictor k) : ℝ :=
  var dgp signal

/-- Variance of the DGP's conditional-mean outcome. -/
noncomputable def outcomeMeanVariance {k : ℕ} [Fintype (Fin k)]
    (dgp : DataGeneratingProcess k) : ℝ :=
  var dgp dgp.trueExpectation

/-- Covariance of a predictor with the DGP's conditional-mean outcome. -/
noncomputable def signalOutcomeCovariance {k : ℕ} [Fintype (Fin k)]
    (dgp : DataGeneratingProcess k) (signal : Predictor k) : ℝ :=
  measureCovariance dgp.jointMeasure
    (fun pc ↦ signal pc.1 pc.2) (fun pc ↦ dgp.trueExpectation pc.1 pc.2)

/-- **The statistical `R²` of a reading is the squared correlation of its three moments.**

This is what makes the reading useful: `rsquared` — an integral expression — is a rational
function of three reals, and every algebraic identity about those reals becomes a
statement about the process.

**The two nondegeneracy premises are gone, and nothing was weakened to remove them.**
They used to read `signalVariance ≠ 0` and `outcomeMeanVariance ≠ 0`, and they were
supplied by the caller as facts about quantities this file defines. They were never
needed: `rsquared` returns `0` by its own guard exactly when one of those variances
vanishes, and in that same case the right-hand side has a zero factor in its denominator,
so it is `0` too — division by zero in Lean is `0`, and here that convention makes the two
sides agree rather than papering over a gap. The identity is therefore unconditional, and
the degenerate case is not an exception to it but an instance of it. -/

/-! ### Effect Heterogeneity: R² and AUC Improvement

When PGS effect size α(c) varies across PC space, using PC-specific coefficients
improves both R² and discrimination.

**Mathematical basis**: If Y = α(c)·P + f(c), then using Ŷ = β·P (single slope) has:
- MSE(raw) = MSE(calibrated) + E[(α(c) - β)² · P²]
- The excess term is strictly positive when α varies

/-! ### Evolutionary Coordinate Library

This block records coarse population-genetic coordinates derived from drift,
mutation, migration, divergence time, and recombination. These coordinates are
useful as primitives, but they are **not** treated here as an independent or
multiplicatively separable transport law for PGS portability.

Biologically, LD decay, allele-frequency change, mutation history, and
migration history interact through locus-specific state. This file therefore
stops at coordinate extraction. Any mechanistic portability claim must proceed
through the explicit SNP/LD-aware state space downstream in
`PortabilityDrift`. -/

    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk18b.py`). Island model with
    the TOTAL emigration rate held fixed at `4 Ne m = 2.0`, deme count swept,
    `F_ST` from coalescence times:

       25       0.33333    0.32598 ± 0.01121     0.65

    The prediction is constant by construction while the measurement climbs
    toward it, so the agreement at 25 demes is not a coincidence of scale: this
    body IS the limit, and it is wrong by 79% at two demes.

    Renamed from `fstDriftMigration` for the same reason and by the same
    reasoning as `PopulationGeneticsFoundations.fstMigrationMutationEquilibriumManyDemes`.
    The signature is `(p : EvolutionaryParameters)` and reads `p.bigM` alone, so
    no edit to the body can express a deme count; what could be fixed is the
    claim the name makes. The deme-carrying form is
    `fstIslandEquilibriumFiniteDemes`, whose `islandDemeCorrection = d/(d-1)` is
    validated on these same five deme counts at worst 2.74 sems -- and whose
    squared variant is excluded at 9.04 sems.

    This is the third definition in this corpus found to be deme-count blind,
    after `fstMigrationMutationEquilibriumManyDemes` and `asymmetricFst`. The
    first two were repaired by naming the limit; `asymmetricFst` could not be,
    because its name commits it to exactly two demes, so it was repaired by
    carrying both migration rates and returning the two-deme value at their sum.

/-- **One generation of the identity-by-descent balance under all three
forces.**

`F` is the probability that two gene copies drawn from the same population are
identical by descent.  In one generation drift makes a pair identical with
probability `1/(2 Nₑ)` among the pairs that are not already identical, and each
of the two lineages independently leaves the local identity class at rate
`mig + mu` -- by being replaced by a migrant, or by mutating away from its
ancestral allelic state.  Migration and mutation enter through their *sum*
because, to first order, either event destroys identity and neither can undo
the other.

Composition convention: the three forces are added, not composed, so their
within-generation ordering does not matter.  This is the first-order
(weak-force, large-`Nₑ`) model; the unlinearised recursion multiplies
`(1 - mig)²(1 - mu)²` against `1 - 1/(2 Nₑ)` and has a fixed point differing at
`O(mig², mu², mig/Nₑ)`.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk3.py`,
    `test_ibd_flow_step_dgp`). One generation of drift with flow from a fixed

/-- **The same balance with the migration rate carrying the two-deme
correction.**

`fstDriftFlowStep` above draws migrants from a FIXED SOURCE POOL, which is the
regime its validation was run in and which is the many-deme limit: a migrant
arrives from an unrelated population, so migration only destroys identity and
never restores it. At two demes the source pool is the other deme, and a pair of
lineages moves between the same-deme and different-deme states in BOTH
directions. The rate that matters for differentiation is the sum of those two,
emigration plus immigration, which at `d` demes is `m · d/(d - 1)` --
`PopulationGeneticsFoundations.islandDemeCorrection` -- and at `d = 2` is `2 m`.

Mutation is untouched: a mutation destroys identity wherever the lineage sits,
so there is no return channel to correct for. That asymmetry is the whole
difference between this step and the one above, and it is what
`fstEquilibrium`'s measurement selects.

    Empirical status: DERIVED. This is `fstDriftFlowStep` at the deme-corrected
    migration rate; its equilibrium is what carries the measurement, on
    `fstEquilibrium` below. -/

/-- **Full equilibrium Fst** under drift + mutation + migration, at two demes:
    Fst = 1/(1 + θ + 2·M). Both mutation and migration counteract drift, and
    they compose ADDITIVELY -- but the migration term carries the deme-count
    correction and the mutation term does not.

    Not stipulated: `fstEquilibrium_isFixedPoint` derives it as the rest point
    of `fstDemeCorrectedFlowStep`.  With `θ = 4 Nₑ μ` and `M = 4 Nₑ m`,
    balancing `(1 - F)/(2 Nₑ)` against `2(2m + μ)F` gives
    `F (1 + 4 Nₑ (2m + μ)) = 1`, and `4 Nₑ (2m + μ) = θ + 2M` is why the two
    scaled rates add at that weighting.

    Why the factor two sits on migration alone. The homogenising force a deme
    feels is not its emigration rate but the rate at which a pair of lineages
    switches between the same-deme and different-deme states, which is the
    emigration rate PLUS the immigration rate. In a `d`-deme island model those
    are `M` and `M/(d - 1)`, so their sum is `M · d/(d - 1)` --
    `PopulationGeneticsFoundations.islandDemeCorrection`, which at `d = 2` is
    exactly 2. Mutation destroys identity wherever the lineage sits and so
    carries no such factor. The general form is
    `PopulationGeneticsFoundations.fstIslandEquilibriumFiniteDemes`, which
    carries `nDemes` explicitly; `EvolutionaryParameters` has no deme count, so
    this body is the two-deme member of that family and its regime says so.

    Regime: two-deme island model with mutation, at mutation-migration-drift
    balance.

    Worst cell 1.10 sems. Three competitors ride the same cells and are all
    excluded: the superseded body `1/(1+θ+M)` at 7.58 sems, the multiplicative
    composition `1/((1+θ)(1+M))` at 5.37, and the SQUARED correction
    `1/(1+θ+4M)` at 5.37. The squared form matters because
    `islandDemeCorrection` had `(d/(d-1))²` excluded once already; this design
    excludes it again through a second observable.

    Power: the prediction spans 0.2500 to 0.0741 across the design, a factor of
    3.4, and θ and M are varied against each other rather than together -- the
    two cells at θ+M = 2 differ by 38% in this body and not at all in the
    superseded one, which is what makes the weighting refutable and not just
    the sum.

    WHAT THE SUPERSEDED RECORD GOT WRONG. `battery_bulk38.py` falsified
    `1/(1+θ+M)` twice, correctly, and concluded "NO SIMPLE COMPOSITION
    SURVIVES" because the only alternatives it carried were the multiplicative
    one and dropping a parameter. It never tried the additive composition at a
    corrected migration weight, so it read a deme-count error as a composition
    error. The composition was additive all along. This is the same blindness
    the corpus already recorded on `fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium`, reached from
    the other side: there the missing factor was visible in the control, here it
    was hiding in the cells.

### Note for anyone editing the Fst cluster below

Twice today this cluster broke as a side effect of moving or absorbing a
definition elsewhere, both times in `unfold` lists rather than in any
mathematics. Recording the shape of both, because the sweeps that follow such
moves have not been catching them.

**Stale unfold targets.** `unfold X` is an error, not a no-op, when `X` does not
occur in the goal. So when a definition stops routing through another, *every*
`unfold` list naming the inner one breaks at once. `fstEquilibrium` above is
`1 / (1 + θ + 2 M)` and `fstDriftMigrationManyDemes` is `1 / (1 + M)`; neither calls
`fstMutationDriftEquilibrium`, and only `fstDriftMutation` did. One stale name
in the lists below produced seven simultaneous failures, which reads like a
change of shape in the definition itself and is not one — the definition is a
plain `def (θ : ℝ) : ℝ := 1 / (1 + θ)` throughout and unfolds fine.

**Shape-unaware repointing.** `fstDriftMutation p` was a wrapper for
`fstMutationDriftEquilibrium p.theta`, was removed as a duplicate, and its call
sites were repointed textually. That is correct at sites that *apply* it and
wrong at sites that only *name* it: inside an `unfold` list the argument glued
onto the constant, giving `fstMutationDriftEquilibrium.theta`, which is not a
constant. It was caught only because the mangling happened to be ill-formed. A
repoint that stayed well-formed would have compiled and been silent.

The general rule the two share: a textual repoint sees applications. It does not
see bare constant names in `unfold`/`simp only`/`rw` argument lists, and it does
not see docstrings — a third instance left an orphaned doc comment above the
`Step 2` section header when `migrationLDBoost` moved.

(That sentence originally quoted the doc-comment opener literally. Lean nests
block comments, so the quoted opener opened one, the closer below shut only
that, and this note left its own module unterminated — the failure
the `identifications` guard in check.py counts delimiters for. Do not write the opener
literally in prose here.)

/-- **Shared LD retention** under recombination and divergence.
    The fraction of LD shared between populations is the probability that
    NEITHER lineage recombines between the two loci over `t_div` meioses, which
    is `(1-r)` per meiosis per lineage and so `(1-r)^(2·t_div)` -- the exponent
    is `2·t_div` because both lineages must avoid recombination independently.

    CORRECTED from `exp(-2·r·t_div)`, which is this body's small-`r` limit and
    was FALSIFIED as an exact law. The record of that falsification is kept
    below because it is what fixed the body: the exponential errs HIGH, second
    order in `r`, and the design showed the error growing with `r` exactly as
    `exp(-2rt)` against `(1-r)^(2t)` requires. `discreteRecombinationSurvival`
    is the same survival at an integer generation count, and this is its square
    at a real one.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED** (`simcov/battery_sld03.py`), on the IDENTICAL design that
    falsified the body it replaces -- same three cells, same 400000 replicates, same oracle.
    A corrected body has to be put back to the measurement that rejected the old one; a new
    design that happens to agree would be answering a different question.

      r      t     this body   two-lineage survival   sems
      0.01    20    0.669024      0.669018 ± 0.00100   0.01

      0.05    40    0.016530      0.016528 ± 0.00014   0.02

    Worst 0.31 sems at 0.13% relative, against 13.09 sems and 10.8% for the exponential. Both
    competitors are refuted on the same cells: the superseded `exp(-2·r·t_div)` at 13.09 sems
    -- the same number the original run reported, now carried as the rival it is -- and
    `(1-r)^t_div`, the ploidy factor dropped, at 823 sems. The positive control is the
    ONE-lineage survival against `discreteRecombinationSurvival`, an independently known
    quantity that is not this body, passing at 0.05 sems.

    Empirical status of the SUPERSEDED exponential body, kept because it is what fixed this
    one: **FALSIFIED** as an exact law, VALIDATED as a small-`r` approximation
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_transfer.py`,
    `test_ld_decay_defs`). The exact survival of two independent lineages over
    `t_div` meioses is `(1 - r)^(2 t_div)`, which is
    `discreteRecombinationSurvival` squared; this definition is its continuous
    limit and the gap is second order in `r`:

      r       t     this def   simulated            sems     relative
      0.01    20     0.67032   0.66902±0.00100      1.30       +0.2%

    High in every cell, and the error grows with `r` exactly as `exp(-2rt)`
    against `(1-r)^(2t)` requires. At `r = 0.05` it is eleven percent, which is
    not a rounding difference. Use the exact form where `r` is not small.

/-- **Mutation-induced LD erosion**: new mutations create population-specific LD
    that is not shared. The fraction of LD that remains "ancestral" (shared)
    decays exponentially with the scaled mutation rate.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED** (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk16.py` and
    `battery_bulk16b.py`). The composition asserts
    `exp(-theta * tau) = exp(-4 Ne mu * t/(2 Ne)) = exp(-2 mu t)`: the chance
    that NEITHER lineage of a sampled pair has mutated in `t` generations. `Ne`
    cancels, and that cancellation is the content worth testing, because a
    scaled parameter composed with a scaled time is exactly where this branch
    has already found factor errors. Measured as the fraction of 400000
    replicate lineage pairs carrying no mutation:

      Ne     mu        t      theta*tau   predicted  measured             sems
      250    1.0e-3    125     0.25        0.77880   0.77779 ± 0.00066    1.54

    `theta * tau` runs over a factor of eight while `Ne` independently runs over
    a factor of eight, so the functional form and the cancellation are under
    test at once. The three rows at `theta*tau = 2.00` carry `Ne` of 250, 500
    and 1000 and agree to 0.6%: `Ne` really does drop out.

    The competing one-lineage reading `exp(-mu t)` is carried through the same
    measurement and misses by up to 433 sems and 174% relative, so the factor of
    two in "two lineages" is chosen by the data rather than argued.

    An earlier version of this design held `theta * tau = 1` in every cell so
    that the cancellation would be visible, and the verdict gate called NO POWER
    on it -- correctly, since a prediction that never moves cannot reject a
    wrong functional form no matter what else the design shows. The numbers
    above are from the redone design.

    This is the same arithmetic as `PortabilityDrift.mutationSharedRetentionAt`
    stated on the DGP parameter record, so it SHARES that measurement rather
    than having an independent one, and the status is recorded as shared. -/

    alleles from the other population. Models as a correction factor ≥ 1.

    Empirical status: **FALSIFIED in magnitude; the direction is right**
    (`simcov/battery_bulk55.py`). Two demes split at the same time, with and
    WITHOUT ongoing migration, and the observable is the RATIO of their
    cross-deme LD correlation -- a ratio, so no scale has to be fixed. The
    control, a split at `t = 1` where the two demes are effectively one
    population, gives `F_ST = 0.0002`.

      1.0   16.0     1.9412      1.3189 ± 0.0465

    Worst cell 18.17 sems at 24.8% relative, and the gap WIDENS with both
    arguments -- at `τ = 1, bigM = 16` the body predicts a 94% boost against a
    measured 32%.

    The direction survives, which is why this is a magnitude failure and not a
    shape one. A boost of exactly 1 -- no restoration from migration at all --
    sits 11.13 sems from the measurements, and the measured boost does rise with
    both `τ` and `bigM`, saturating in `bigM` as the body says. So migration
    does restore shared LD; it restores roughly a third of what this factor
    claims.

    Read together with `PortabilityDrift.sharedLD_from_equilibrium`, which finds
    LD already largely shared without any migration, the picture is consistent:
    most of the sharing is inherited from before the split, so there is less
    left for migration to restore than a model starting from zero would expect.

    `PortabilityDrift.migrationSharedBoostAt` is the same expression at
    generation `t` and is falsified by the same run. -/

`kappa` — a positivity fact, not a map, not monotone in Fst, and with no covariance
anywhere; its `0 < θ + M` hypothesis was unused.  `fstEquilibrium_pos` is the content.

/-! ## End-to-End: From Population Genetics to Clinical Accuracy Metrics

This section builds the evolutionary side of the deployment pipeline from
evolutionary primitives (Ne, μ, m, r, t) to clinical accuracy coordinates
(`R²`, AUC, Brier score) once an explicit target signal variance is supplied.
Time since divergence enters through the evolutionary coordinates only.

**The chain:**
1. Evolutionary parameters expose primitive divergence/sharing coordinates
   (`Fst(t)`, LD, mutation-history, migration-history)
2. These coordinates remain a coarse record only; DGP does not assume that they
   are independent, multiplicatively separable, or jointly sufficient for a
   biological portability law
3. A separate mechanistic transport theorem supplies explicit target signal variance
4. That target signal variance maps to target `R²(t)`, AUC(t), and Brier(t)

These coarse coordinates change over time as Fst grows, LD changes, mutation
changes shared ancestral content, and migration changes sharing history. The
deployed metrics in this section are then read off from exact coordinate maps
applied to an explicit target signal variance supplied elsewhere.

### Key scope note
An `EvolutionaryParameters` structure determines only the primitive
evolutionary coordinates in this file, and an observational context adds residual
scale and disease prevalence for metric evaluation. That is enough for exact
algebra on the chosen coordinates, but it is not by itself a full SNP/LD
state-space model of transport. The mechanistic transport objects live
downstream in
`PortabilityDrift.CrossPopulationMetricModel`,
`PortabilityDrift.sourceWeightedTagScore`,
`PortabilityDrift.r2FromSourceWeights`, and
`TransferLearningPGS.transportedTargetR2_eq_ldRgSq_mul_targetH2_sharedLD`.

/-! ### Step 1: Transient Fst as a function of time

For populations that have not yet reached equilibrium, Fst(t) grows from 0
toward the equilibrium value. We use the transient formula derived in
PopulationGeneticsFoundations from the heterozygosity recurrence with mutation.

Fst(t) = Fst_eq × (1 - λ^t) where λ = (1-1/(2N))(1-θ/(2N))

At equilibrium (t → ∞), Fst → Fst_eq = 1/(1+θ+M).
-/

/-- Per-generation heterozygosity retention factor under drift + mutation.
    λ = (1 - 1/(2Ne)) × (1 - θ/(2Ne))
    Derived from the Wright-Fisher recurrence with mutation:
    H(t+1) = (1-1/(2N)) × (1-μ)² × H(t) + mutation_input
    where (1-μ)² ≈ 1 - 2μ = 1 - θ/(2N).

    Empirical status: UNTESTED. -/

/-- **Transient Fst(t)**: Fst as a function of divergence time.
    Fst(t) = Fst_eq × (1 - λ^t)
    where Fst_eq = 1/(1+θ+M) and λ = `fstTransientDecayFromScaled`.

    At t=0: Fst = 0 (no divergence yet).
    As t → ∞: Fst → Fst_eq (equilibrium).

    **The decay base was `hetDecayFactor` and has been corrected.** That base
    carries drift and mutation but not migration, so this coordinate approached
    an equilibrium that depends on `M` at a rate that does not -- and the error
    is not small: at `4 Nₑ m = 16` it overstates the half-life by a factor of
    seventeen. The derivation quoted below is where it came from and is the
    error itself: `Fst(t) = 1 - H(t)/H₀` reads the transient off the WITHIN-deme
    heterozygosity recurrence, which migration does not enter, and then attaches
    it to a between-deme equilibrium, which migration does. See
    `fstTransientDecayFromScaled` for the measurement.

    DERIVED from the heterozygosity recurrence H(t) = H* + (H₀ - H*) × λ^t
    and Fst(t) = 1 - H(t)/H₀ -- valid for the mutation-drift model, where
    `MutationDriftModelAssumptions.fstTransient` still uses it and is right to,
    because that model has no migration in it at all.

/-! ### Step 2: Primitive evolutionary coordinate summaries

The four coarse coordinates are kept side by side:

- allele-frequency divergence/sharing coordinate
- LD-history coordinate
- mutation-history coordinate
- migration-history coordinate

This block does not multiply them into a single trait-level transport scalar,
does not treat them as independent mechanisms, does not reconstruct source
signal from source `R²`, and does not derive target deployed metrics from
source `R²` plus any global retention factor.
-/

/-! ### Scope of this deployment block

The next definitions intentionally stop short of an end-to-end portability law.
They provide:

- primitive evolutionary coordinate summaries; and
- generic metric coordinate maps once an explicit target signal variance is
  supplied.

They do **not** evolve SNP weights, tag/causal covariance matrices, or target
effect-size vectors directly. The lower-level SNP/LD-aware transport objects
live in:

- `PortabilityDrift.CrossPopulationMetricModel`, where the named drivers are
  source/target tag LD, tag-causal alignment, source/target effect vectors,
  source/target context cross-covariances, and explicit additive target-side
  residual losses for broken tagging, ancestry-specific LD distortion, and
  source-specific overfit;
- `PortabilityDrift.targetEffectHeterogeneity`, where cross-population effect
  mismatch is a locus-resolved vector `β_target - β_source`, not a scalar
  retention coordinate;
- `PortabilityDrift.taggingProjection_target_eq_source_effect_plus_effectHeterogeneity`,
  where the transported target signal is decomposed into the part induced by
  source-stable effects plus the separate projection of target-effect
  heterogeneity;
- `PortabilityDrift.betaTargetAt`, where time-varying target effects are
  generated from source effects plus an explicit generation-indexed
  heterogeneity path;
- `PortabilityDrift.sourceWeightedTagScore`, which is the explicit SNP-level
  score equation applying source-learned weights to any source or target
  tag-genotype state;
- `PortabilityDrift.r2FromSourceWeights`, where transported source weights
  are evaluated against that full explicit state through the target LD and
  target tag-to-causal covariance operators; and
- `PortabilityDrift.targetMetricProfileFromSourceWeights`, where the deployed
  `R²`/AUC/Brier profile is bundled directly from that mechanistic score
  equation; and
- `TransferLearningPGS.transportedTargetR2_eq_ldRgSq_mul_targetH2_sharedLD`,
  where transport is expressed in source/target effect vectors under a shared
  LD kernel.

Those mechanistic theorems are now the required route for any biological claim
about target `R²`, AUC, or Brier.
-/

/-! ### Canonical transported metric surface

`TransportedMetrics` is the single canonical forward map from:

- explicit target signal variance
- baseline residual variance scale
- explicit additive target-side penalty budget
- prevalence

to the deployed target metrics (`R²`, AUC, Brier). Other files should expose
specialized observable or methodological wrappers only via exact specialization
lemmas back to this namespace.

/-- **The explained-variance ratio really is the `R²` of a data-generating process** —
under a regime that is now written down rather than assumed.

Two hypotheses carry the whole modelling content, and both are discharged by the caller:

* `h_additive` says the outcome's conditional mean tracks the signal one for one, i.e. the
  outcome is the signal plus a residual uncorrelated with it. This is the additive-noise
  regime. Outside it the covariance is not the signal variance and the ratio below is not
  an `R²` — it is a number.
* `h_split` says the outcome variance decomposes as signal plus `V_E`, which is what makes
  `V_E` deserve the name "environmental variance" rather than being an arbitrary second
  argument.

This is the bridge the development was missing. `presentDayR2`, and with it every drift,
mutation-drift and generational `R²`, is `r2FromSignalVariance` applied to a different signal
variance, so each of them inherits this theorem instead of needing its own. Before it,
the statement "this quotient is the `R²` of the process" was not something the corpus
could express, let alone check: the quotient was a definition, and a definition cannot be
wrong. -/

/-- **AUC of the equal-variance Gaussian model**, from signal and residual
    variances.

    **Not the liability-threshold AUC.** The docstring here used to call it
    that. The liability-threshold AUC depends on prevalence, which this
    signature cannot express, and its sibling
    `equalVarianceGaussianAUCFromSignalVariance` -- which now calls this body --
    carries the marker recording that the liability reading is falsified. Two
    copies of one formula had drifted to opposite claims about which quantity
    it is; that is why they are one definition now.

    For positive residual variance this is `Φ(√(vSignal / (2 · vNoise)))`.
    At `vNoise = 0`, positive signal is perfect prediction and therefore has
    AUC `1`; the zero-signal degenerate case is assigned `Φ 0`. This explicit
    boundary prevents total real division from silently mapping a perfect
    predictor to chance discrimination.

    Empirical status: VALIDATED for the equal-variance Gaussian model at
    positive residual variance. Measured against Monte-Carlo of the underlying
    two-Gaussian model, 200000 draws per point: predicted against simulated
    `0.760250/0.760040`, `0.921350/0.921505`, `0.999797/0.999820`,
    `1.000000/1.000000` at `vNoise = 1, 0.25, 0.04, 0.01` with `vSignal = 1`;
    largest absolute difference `2.1e-4`. Power: the prediction spans `0.760`
    to `1.000` across that design, so a wrong functional form of this shape
    would separate. The zero-noise boundary is fixed analytically by the
    perfect-discrimination value.

    Correct as it stands: this is a genuine two-Gaussian model and the
    validation above is against that model, not against a dichotomised trait.
    The binary-trait counterpart is
    `PortabilityDrift.liabilityThresholdAUCFromExplainedR2`, which takes a
    prevalence; do not substitute this one for it.

    A second, independent measurement of the same claim
    (`simcov/battery_bulk33.py`, `group_a`).
    The AUC is COUNTED, not computed: two Gaussian score distributions with
    equal variance and a mean separation of `√vSignal`, and the observable is
    the fraction of 800000 case/control pairs the score orders correctly.
    Predicted 0.76025, 0.84134, 0.69146 and 0.69146 against counted 0.76058 ±
    0.00048, 0.84098 ± 0.00041, 0.69207 ± 0.00052 and 0.69200 ± 0.00052 --
    worst cell 1.17 sems at 0.09% relative.

    Power: the two errors this shape attracts are carried on the same cells and
    both are FALSIFIED. Dropping the factor of two, `Φ(√(vSignal/vNoise))`,
    misses by 197 sems; dropping the square root, `Φ(vSignal/(2·vNoise))`,
    misses by 181 sems. The `√2` is the standard deviation of the DIFFERENCE of
    two independent equal-variance scores, which is what an AUC compares, and
    the design pins it: the last two cells hold `vSignal/vNoise` fixed at 0.5
    while moving both variances, so a body sensitive to their scale rather than
    their ratio would separate there. Control: with no separation the counted
    AUC is 1/2. -/

variance, and residual variance.

This is the direct moment form of the calibrated Brier coordinate. It is not
defined by first constructing transported `R²`; any equality to the `R²`
chart is a derived algebraic identity.

    Empirical status: **CONDITIONALLY VALID** -- it holds when
    `vSignal/(vSignal + vResidual)` is the explained fraction of the
    OBSERVED-SCALE variance, and is FALSIFIED when those are liability
    variances. Both regimes are now measured, and measured against each other.
    The word "exact" in the summary line above was the defect: it is exact in
    one regime and the argument names point at the other.

    IN REGIME (`simcov/battery_falsrepair.py`, `group_d`). The calibrated
    probability is drawn `Beta` with mean `π` and variance `r²·π(1-π)` on the
    observed scale, the outcome is `Bernoulli(p)`, and the observable is the
    realised mean squared error over 8×10⁵ draws with the sem from 20 blocks:

      π     r²      this body   realised            sems   liability form
      0.50  0.500    0.12500    0.125345 ± 0.00053   0.65     0.166667

    **The in-regime agreement is AN IDENTITY, not evidence.** `Brier = E[p(1-p)]
    = π(1-π) - Var(p)` holds for any calibrated `p`, and the design supplies
    `Var(p)` as `r²·π(1-π)`, so the body could not have missed. What the run
    does establish is the SEPARATION: the liability-scale form
    `π - Φ₂(Φ⁻¹(π), Φ⁻¹(π); r²)` -- which reproduces every cell of the
    falsifying liability run below -- is excluded here at up to 107 sems, and
    `π(1-π)(1-r²)²` at up to 118. Control at `r² = 0`, where a prevalence-only
    predictor must score exactly `π(1-π)`: 0.209564 ± 0.000315 against 0.210000,
    0.66 sems. So which regime a caller is in is settled by measurement in both
    directions rather than by argument, and the two regimes disagree by 9% to
    47% wherever `r²` is neither 0 nor 1.

    Where it is exact. If the calibrated probability `p` is itself a random variable with
    `E[p] = π` and `Var(p) = σ²`, then `Brier = E[p(1-p)] = π(1-π) - σ²` identically, so the
    body is right when `vSignal/(vSignal+vResidual)` is `σ²/(π(1-π))`. That is the
    additive-noise regime `r2FromSignalVariance_eq_rsquared` states, on the OBSERVED scale.

    Where it fails. A binary outcome produced by a liability threshold is not in that regime:
    `vSignal` and `vResidual` are LIABILITY variances, and the explained fraction on the
    liability scale is not the explained fraction of `π(1-π)`. Measured against the realised
    mean squared error of the true conditional probability over 8×10⁵ draws:

    The exact liability-scale value is `π - Φ₂(Φ⁻¹(π), Φ⁻¹(π); r²)` with `r²` the liability
    explained fraction and `Φ₂` the standard bivariate normal CDF at correlation `r²`; that
    form reproduces all four cells to between 5×10⁻⁵ and 2.5×10⁻³ relative, which is what
    shows the disagreement is the scale and not the simulation. It is not written as a body
    here because `Φ₂` has no Mathlib form this corpus can call, and a wrong closed form is
    worse than a named regime.

    Why the anchor theorems did not catch it: `calibratedBrier_anchors` and
    `calibratedBrierFromVariances_no_residual` pin `r² = 0` and `r² = 1`, and BOTH forms agree
    at both endpoints -- `Φ₂(z,z;0) = π²` and `Φ₂(z,z;1) = π`. The anchors pin a linear
    dependence on `r²` only if linearity is assumed, and the liability form is not linear
    in `r²`. Two anchors cannot distinguish a line from a curve through the same two points.

    CONSUMERS. `PortabilityDrift.sourceCalibratedBrierFromSourceWeightsAtPrevalence` feeds
    this from PGS explained-signal variances at a prevalence, which is the liability-threshold
    setting, so it inherits the error at the sizes tabulated above.

/-! ### Step 4: Coordinate-Rate Summaries

The evolutionary block records per-force rate coordinates only. These rates are
useful for comparing the timescales of distinct population-genetic drivers, but
they are not added or multiplied into a single portability law. -/

/-- **Allele-frequency divergence rate: the drift rate, and only the drift rate.**

    `1 / (2 Nₑ)`. Two populations leaving a common ancestral state accumulate
    frequency variance at the rate drift supplies it. Mutation and migration do
    not slow that accumulation; they set the LEVEL it stops at, which is
    `fstEquilibrium = 1/(1 + θ + M)`, and the two are different quantities.

    **The body has been corrected and the arguments are now inert.** It read
    `1 / (2 Nₑ (1 + θ + M))` -- the equilibrium divided by the coalescent
    timescale -- which says a population under strong migration diverges from
    its neighbours more slowly per generation. From a common start it cannot:
    migration and mutation are deterministic maps applied identically to every
    replicate, so in the first generation they move every replicate the same way
    and contribute nothing at all to the across-replicate variance.

    `alleleFreqDivergenceRate_independent_of_mutation_and_migration` states that
    inertness, because a definition that takes three arguments and reads one is
    otherwise indistinguishable from a definition that lost the other two.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED after correction; the superseded body
    FALSIFIED at up to 1620 sems**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_dis1.py`). Across-replicate
    variance of the allele frequency after ONE generation from a common start,
    normalised by `p₀(1-p₀)`, 20000 replicate populations and 400 loci:

      Ne    θ     M     superseded   this body   measured
      200   0.0   0.0   0.002500     0.002500    0.0025003
      200   0.8   0.0   0.001389     0.002500    0.0025002
      200   0.0   0.8   0.001389     0.002500    0.0025000
      200   4.0   4.0   0.000278     0.002500    0.0025098
      500   0.0   4.0   0.000200     0.001000    0.0010000

    The superseded body is right in exactly one row -- the one where `θ` and `M`
    are both zero and the two bodies are the same number. This body's worst cell
    is 0.4 percent relative, at the design where `θ = M = 4`, and that residual
    is the second-order term: over one generation the three forces compose
    rather than add.

    The positive control is that row, against the textbook drift variance
    `p(1-p)/(2 Nₑ)`, and it passes at 0.36 sems.

    Power: the superseded prediction spans a factor of nine across the design
    while the measurement is flat, which is the whole finding.

    Denotes: a per-generation RATE. Other definitions share this formula under
    names from the timescale family -- `1/(2 Nₑ)` is also the reciprocal
    coalescent timescale -- and the formula does not fix which is meant. That
    those two coincide here is the content, not a collision: divergence
    accumulates on the coalescent clock and on no other. -/

/-- **The allele-frequency divergence rate at zero effective size, named.** Drift is

This replaces `alleleFreqDivergenceRate_unit_theta`, which evaluated the superseded body at
`theta = 1` and got `1 / (4 Ne)` -- half the drift rate. That theorem was stated as a second
reference point, on the reasoning that `alleleFreqDivergenceRate_neutral_isolated` pins the
outer `2 * Ne` and nothing else, so a point where `theta` is nonzero is needed to separate
bodies of the form `1 / (2 Ne (1 + c₁ θ + c₂ M))`. The reasoning was right and the answer it
pinned was wrong: measurement puts `c₁ = c₂ = 0` at up to 1620 sems, so the discriminating
statement is not a second value but this invariance.

It is stated over ALL arguments rather than at a point, because that is the claim: two
populations diverge at the drift rate whatever the mutation and migration rates are. -/

/-- LD breakage rate from recombination.

    Regime: a RATE, first order in `r`. Two lineages each recombine with
    probability `r`, and to first order the chance that either does is their sum.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED as a rate, FALSIFIED as an exact
    per-generation probability** (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_traj.py`).
    The exact chance that a pair survives one meiosis intact is `(1-r)²`, so the
    exact breakage probability is `2r - r²` and this body omits the `r²`. Read as
    a survival law, `(1 - 2r)^t` against the exact `(1 - r)^(2t)`, the omission
    compounds:

      r      t     (1 - 2r)^t   simulated             relative
      0.01   20     0.66761     0.66860 ± 0.00033      -0.1%
      0.02   30     0.29386     0.29796 ± 0.00032      -1.4%
      0.05   15     0.20589     0.21444 ± 0.00029      -4.0%

    Four percent at `r = 0.05`. This is the discrete twin of the continuous
    approximation recorded on `sharedLDRetention`, which errs in the other
    direction and by the same second-order term; use
    `discreteRecombinationSurvival` where `r` is not small.

    Restating the verdict above, since the distinction is the whole content:
    VALIDATED as the RATE at which a sampled pair breaks,
    and FALSIFIED as an exact per-generation probability -- the two readings are
    the `r²` above, and the table there is the falsification of the second.

    The rate reading is the one the `2` is about, and a simulation decides it
    (`simcov/battery_bulk18.py`, `test_ld_breakage`): the survival of a pair in
    which NEITHER of the two lineages has recombined between the loci, over
    400000 replicate pairs per cell, with `2·r·t` swept over a factor of three
    at two different `r`. The body predicts 0.60653, 0.36788, 0.36788 and
    0.22313 against measured 0.60660 ± 0.00077, 0.36732 ± 0.00076, 0.36648 ±
    0.00076 and 0.22293 ± 0.00066, worst cell 1.84 sems at 0.38% relative.

    Power: the ONE-LINEAGE reading `r` is carried on the same cells, so the
    factor of two is chosen by the data rather than by the name. It misses by
    223, 314, 315 and 379 sems (up to 112% relative). The two `2·r·t = 1` cells
    reach the same prediction from `r` and `t` moved in opposite directions, so
    a body that depended on them separately would not survive both. -/
