# What a distance array cannot see, and what alignment can

A family of populations carrying ancestry-specific outcome fields is a metric measure space with
a decoration: allele-frequency divergence supplies the metric, sampling weight the measure, and
the population-specific conditional risk the mark.  Three finite facts about that object, each
stated exactly and each with a biological reading.

* **Profile twins.**  Two populations equidistant from every population are invisible to the
  divergence matrix: transposing them leaves every entry unchanged.  Equal allele frequencies
  produce exactly this degeneracy in Hudson's `F_ST`.  A decoration breaks it -- which is what
  ancestry-specific outcome data buys, and it is not a rate improvement but an identifiability
  one.

* **Margin versus alignment.**  A functional of the decoration alone is invariant under every
  weight-preserving relabelling of the populations, so it cannot see how the decoration sits on
  the geometry.  The metric-weighted Dirichlet energy can: three populations, one multiset of
  risks, two assignments, and the alignment energies are `10/3` and `2` while the margin energies
  are equal.  This is the same obstruction as the gauge witness of
  `ContinuumCalibrationProgram`, now with the metric supplying the weights.

* **Rare populations are not proportionally rare.**  A subpopulation of frequency `ε` carrying a
  different conditional moves a variance-type functional by order `√ε`, not `ε`.  No Lipschitz
  constant in the frequency exists: the exponent is exactly one half, and it is the contamination
  geometry that forces it.  A group too small to perturb any mass-based distance can still
  dominate a variance-based calibration report.

A fourth, in the same spirit, about resources rather than geometry.

* **Budget and noise are conjugate, not reciprocal.**  Clipping an inverse at budget `Λ` and
  reading a modulus of continuity at noise `ε` are related by a Legendre-type trade, not by
  `ε = 1/Λ`.  The always-true half is recorded, and a two-mode witness shows the reciprocal
  dictionary failing at maximum strength: budgeted error `0` against modulus `1`.

Each is stated in the generality it holds in: an arbitrary finite family of populations, an
arbitrary nonnegative weight, an arbitrary divergence.  The explicit witnesses are there to show
the general theorems are not vacuous and that their converses fail, not to stand in for them.

None of this is asymptotic.  Every statement below is an identity or an inequality between finite
sums, and the witnesses are explicit.

/-! ### The three-population witness

Three populations at divergences `1`, `2`, `3`; the same three risks in both assignments; equal
sampling weights.  The margin cannot tell the assignments apart because it never looks at the
geometry.  The alignment energy separates them by a factor of `5/3`, and the direction of the
separation is the biologically meaningful one: putting the extreme risks on the two most diverged
populations costs more Dirichlet energy than putting them on adjacent ones.

/-! ## Rare populations are not proportionally rare

A subpopulation at frequency `ε` carrying a different conditional contributes `ε(1 - ε)` to a
variance functional, hence `√(ε(1-ε))` to its square root.  Against a contamination-type
distance, which charges the perturbation `ε`, the functional therefore moves like `√ε`: the
exponent is one half and no Lipschitz constant exists.  The practical reading is blunt.  A group
small enough to leave every mass-based diagnostic unmoved can still be the dominant term in a
variance-based calibration report, and shrinking it does not shrink its influence proportionally.

/-! ## Budget and noise are conjugate, not reciprocal

A recalibration with a bounded coefficient is a clipped inverse: on a spectral mode of root gain
`g` it keeps the fraction `(1 - Λ g)` of the error, clipped at zero, and the worst mode decides.
A modulus of continuity instead asks how large a source can hide below a noise level.  The two
are traded against each other by a Legendre-type calibration, and the reciprocal dictionary
`ε = 1/Λ` is not the trade: the witness below has budgeted error `0` where the reciprocal reading
predicts `1`.

the `max` exists to prevent. -/

source evaluated at a reciprocal. -/

root gain `1/2`, at budget `2`, is fully corrected: its budgeted error is zero.  The modulus of
continuity read at the reciprocal noise level `1/2` reports the whole source, one.  So budgeted
error is not the modulus evaluated at the reciprocal of the budget, and no constant repairs the
identification -- the gap here is the entire quantity.  Budget and noise are conjugate variables;
only the Legendre inequality above transfers. -/
