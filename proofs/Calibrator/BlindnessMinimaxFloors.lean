# From blindness witnesses to minimax floors

`ObservationalCeiling` proves a qualitative law: a probe that returns the same data on two
objects certifies neither, so no criterion factoring through it decides any property that
separates them. `FiniteMinimax` proves a quantitative one: two parameters emitting the same
observation law force minimax risk at least half the loss separation, and no downstream
channel repairs it.

Those two files never met. The registry's instances stopped at "no rule reading this probe
decides the property", and the decision-theoretic endpoints stood proved but unconsumed.
This file is the bridge, and it is the reason the bridge is worth building: a blindness
witness is upgraded from *this probe fails* to *every procedure fails, by at least this
much, whatever it does with the data afterwards*.

## The reduction

A `ProbeBlindness probe P` supplies two objects with `probe positive = probe negative`.
Turn it into a two-point decision problem by choosing any **readout** of the probe — a
finite, possibly randomized measurement `Data → FinitePrior n`. The observation kernel is
`readout ∘ probe` at the two witnesses, the action set is the binary verdict `P` holds /
`P` fails, and the loss is `0` for the correct verdict and `1` for the wrong one, so risk
*is* error probability (`risk_readoutProblem`).

`same_data` then says the two observation laws are equal on the nose, and
`half_separation_le_minimaxRisk_of_observation_eq` gives a floor of `1 / 2`: no rule, at
any sample size, with any randomization, beats a coin flip on the worst of the two
hypotheses. `blindReadoutProblem_minimaxRisk` shows the floor is exactly attained, so the
cost of blindness is a coin flip and not more.

Nothing here restricts the readout. It may be noisy, it may quantize, it may be the whole
downstream pipeline folded into one map; `half_le_garbled_readoutProblem_minimaxRisk`
adds the further channel-monotonicity statement on top. This is the sense in which the
ceiling is a ceiling.

## Instances

The three biological instances of the registry that carry an exact witness pair are pushed
through, and two of them are packaged as `ProbeBlindness` witnesses here for the first
time -- previously they existed only as bare equations:

- instance 8, `half_le_averageEffect_minimaxRisk`: no procedure reading the dosage
  regression slope calls additive-versus-dominant right more than half the time at
  `p = 1/2`;
- instance 9, `half_le_normalisedPairwiseSurvival_minimaxRisk`: likewise for the
  coalescent timescale, from the normalised pairwise survival curve;
- instance 10, `half_le_totalFamilyFraction_minimaxRisk`: likewise for sweep origin
  multiplicity, from the total selected-allele frequency.

/-- The two-point decision problem a blindness witness induces, given any finite
randomized **readout** of the probe.

Parameter `0` is the object satisfying `P`, parameter `1` the object failing it. Action `0`
is the verdict "`P` holds", action `1` the verdict "`P` fails". The loss is `0` on the
correct verdict and `1` on the wrong one, so the risk of a rule is exactly its error
probability at that hypothesis.

The readout is arbitrary: any map from probe data to a finite distribution over
observations. Quantization, added noise, repeated sampling folded into a summary, or an
entire analysis pipeline are all instances. What it may not do is see anything other than
the probe -- which is what makes the floor below a statement about the probe rather than
about the analyst. -/

the object bounded here is the coefficient a polygenic score actually fits: at `p = 1/2`,
every rule reading any finite readout of that coefficient misclassifies additive versus
dominant with probability at least one half at one of the two loci. -/
