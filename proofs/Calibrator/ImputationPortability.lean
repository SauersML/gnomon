# Genotype Imputation and PGS Portability

This file formalizes how genotype imputation quality affects PGS
portability. Imputation infers ungenotyped variants from a reference
panel, and its accuracy is ancestry-dependent.

Key results:
1. Imputation quality metrics (r² INFO score)
2. Reference panel diversity affects imputation accuracy
3. Imputation error propagates to PGS accuracy
4. Population-specific imputation quality creates portability artifacts
5. Rare variant imputation challenges

Provenance: derived here, not imported. Wang et al. (2026), Nature Communications 17:942,
substantiates nothing below. It is an empirical study of the polygenic-score portability
gap and does not treat genotype imputation quality. Sources for individual results,
where they exist, are cited at those results.

## Imputation Quality and PGS

Imputation quality is measured by r² (INFO score), the squared
correlation between imputed and true genotypes.

## Reference Panel Effects

The choice of imputation reference panel directly affects
PGS quality across populations.
-/

section ReferencePanel

/-- Imputation quality after multiplying the local LD ceiling by reference-panel match. -/
noncomputable def panelAdjustedImputationQuality (r2_LD panelMatch : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  r2_LD * panelMatch

/-- Panel mismatch cannot exceed the local LD imputation ceiling when LD signal is nonnegative
and panel match is at most one. -/
theorem panelAdjustedImputationQuality_le_ld

        mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_left h_pm_le h_r2
    _ = r2_LD := mul_one _

/-- With a nonzero LD ceiling, the panel-adjusted quality attains that ceiling exactly for a
perfectly matched reference panel. -/
theorem panelAdjustedImputationQuality_eq_ld_iff
    (r2_LD panelMatch : ℝ) (h_ld : r2_LD ≠ 0) :
    panelAdjustedImputationQuality r2_LD panelMatch = r2_LD ↔ panelMatch = 1 := by

      _ = r2_LD * 1 := (mul_one _).symm
  · rintro rfl
    ring

/-- **Imputation quality as a function of LD extent alone.**

    The name carries the restriction because the signature cannot carry the alternative.
    Realised imputation `r²` is dominated by reference-panel size and by minor-allele
    frequency, and neither appears here: this is the LD-extent dependence with everything else
    held fixed, so it cannot be read as a predicted `r²` for a given panel.

    `1 - c / ld_extent` is an `r²` and must lie in `[0, 1]`, but the bare
    expression goes negative for `ld_extent < c` — which is the short-LD limit
    the portability claim is about, not a remote corner. The clamp at `0` is
    what makes this a quality measure at every LD extent; the theorems below
    that need the unclamped branch say so with a hypothesis `c < ld_extent`.

    Empirical status: UNTESTED. -/
noncomputable def ldExtentImputationQuality (c ld_extent : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  max 0 (1 - c / ld_extent)

/-- **ldExtentImputationQuality at its junk point, named.** A panel with no linkage-disequilibrium
extent imputes nothing. The divisor is zero, the penalty term is junk-zero, and the quality
clamps to `1`: PERFECT imputation from a panel that carries no information. The `max 0` guard
protects the lower end and lets the upper end fail unremarked. Consumers must guard the argument
that makes the divisor vanish. -/
theorem ldExtentImputationQuality_zero_extent_is_junk (c : ℝ) :
    ldExtentImputationQuality c 0 = 1 := by
  unfold ldExtentImputationQuality
  simp

/-- The clamped quality measure is an `r²`: it lies in `[0, 1]` for every
positive tagging constant and LD extent, with no side condition. -/

  · linarith

/-- **LD-dependent imputation creates systematic bias.**
    In populations with shorter LD (e.g., AFR), tagging is worse,
    so imputation quality is systematically lower.
    This creates a baseline portability artifact.
    Model: mean imputation r² = `ldExtentImputationQuality c ld_extent`, monotone
    increasing in LD extent. Shorter LD → smaller LD_extent → lower mean
    imputation r². The hypothesis `c < ld_extent_short` is what puts both
    populations on the unclamped branch; below it the measure is `0` in both and
    the comparison is an equality rather than a strict inequality. -/

## Rare Variant Imputation

Rare variants are particularly difficult to impute, and this
difficulty varies dramatically across populations.
-/

section RareVariantImputation


/-- **Population specificity of rare variant imputation.**
    Rare variants are population-specific → they're only in the
    reference panel if the panel includes that population.
    Missing from panel → imputation r² = 0.
    Model: imputation r² = r²_LD × I(variant_in_panel). If the variant
    is absent from the panel, the indicator is 0 and r²_imp = 0. -/
theorem panelAdjustedImputationQuality_eq_zero_of_panel_absent

    (h_missing : variant_in_panel = 0) :
    panelAdjustedImputationQuality r2_LD variant_in_panel = 0 := by
  simp [panelAdjustedImputationQuality, h_missing]

/-- **At unit imputation quality the attenuation factor is one.**

    `attenuatedVariance a b c = a * b * c`, so with all three arguments one this is `1 * 1 * 1`.
    That whole-genome sequencing achieves `r²_imp = 1` is supplied as the hypothesis, not
    derived, and that it therefore removes imputation-related portability artifacts is a reading
    of the arithmetic rather than a consequence of it: no sequencing platform, no variant and no
    portability quantity appears below. -/
theorem wgs_preserves_true_variance

    attenuatedVariance beta_sq het r2_imp_wgs = beta_sq * het := by
  simp [attenuatedVariance, h_perfect]

/-- **Cost-benefit of WGS vs arrays.**
    WGS costs more per sample → smaller sample sizes.
    Arrays allow larger samples but with imputation error.
    Model: R²_WGS(n) = h² × n/(n + C₁), R²_array(n) = h² × r²_imp × n/(n + C₂).
    With budget B, cost_wgs > cost_array → n_wgs < n_array.
    When n_array is sufficiently larger, array R² can exceed WGS R²
    despite r²_imp < 1, because the sample size advantage compensates. -/

## Array Ascertainment Bias

Genotyping arrays are designed for specific populations (typically EUR).
This creates systematic bias in cross-population PGS.

theorem true_portability_loss_at_reference_point :
    true_portability_loss 2 2 = 0 := by
  norm_num [true_portability_loss]


/-- **Ascertainment creates artificial portability loss.**
    Even with identical genetic architecture, the PGS computed
    from an EUR-ascertained array has lower R² in non-EUR
    populations because the array misses non-EUR causal variants.

    **DO NOT COLLAPSE `apparent_portability_loss` INTO `true_portability_loss`.** Both
    bodies are `a - b`, so `validation/extract/equivalence.py` reports them as one
    equivalence class and a duplicate-body sweep will propose merging them. They are two
    different quantities: one is measured against the array actually deployed, the other
    against an ideal non-ascertained design that does not exist. Their arithmetic
    coincides and their referents do not, which is the whole content of this theorem —
    the gap between them is the ascertainment artifact.

    Note honestly what is and is not proved. The first conjunct is a decomposition and is
    an identity (`ring`). The second conjunct is `h_array_worse` restated through the two
    definitions, so it is trivial to prove — but, unlike a vacuous statement, it CAN
    fail: drop the hypothesis and it is false. Contrast
    `DriftRegime.cluster_identities_hold_at_every_retention`, which holds at every value
    of its argument and is intentionally unfalsifiable. -/
