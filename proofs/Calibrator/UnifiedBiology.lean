# Unified biology: state, geometry, value, and observation

This module gives the operator program a biological dictionary without conflating four
mathematically different layers.

* A finite state `x` is a population, ancestry, environment, age, or other biological
  context, and `transition x y` is its transport law.
* `Σ(x)` is observable genotype geometry.  Its generalized eigenvalues are handled by
  `Calibrator.ErgodicCovariancePencil`.
* `θ(x)` is context-specific biological value.  The cost of adapting a readout to it is
  handled by `Calibrator.DirichletTransfer`.
* A probe exposes the parameter only modulo a declared nuisance class.  Identification is
  governed by `Calibrator.DeclaredInteractionClass`, independently of the transport and
  pencil calculations.

The separation matters.  Averaging a target-only score after a stationary transition cannot
measure temporal portability: stationarity removes the transition exactly.  A genuinely
temporal quantity must couple source and target, for example by evaluating a source-chosen
readout at the target or by taking an autocorrelation.  The first section proves this repair
and gives a two-state witness where every target-only average agrees while cross-state
performance changes from perfect to zero.

The final theorem packages eight independent obstructions that a unified biological model
must keep visible: stationarity blindness, loss of joint dependence under marginal summaries,
rank-two value/allocation conflict even in a common eigenbasis, failure of freeness for
operators sharing a local genomic geometry, and four failures of *descent* — of a criterion to
be a function of the label it is reported against.  The descent layer comes from
`Calibrator.DescentGeometry`: a cross-state criterion is not a function of the target context,
reportability along each margin does not compose to the pair, dropping a stratum destroys
reportability both finer labels have, and — although every functional descends along posterior
ancestry — the ancestry-weighted average of component values is not the descended report.

## Epistemic boundary

This file does not promote the analytic claims in the motivating program to Lean theorems.
In particular, Donsker--Varadhan regularity, infinite-volume density of states, a Thouless
formula, Minami/Poisson statistics, and hard-edge random-operator limits require hypotheses
and proofs absent from this corpus.  The formal content here is finite and exact; those
claims remain research interfaces rather than axioms disguised as results.

/-! ## Cohort landscape superposition

Independent cohort objectives add as landscapes, while their covariance kernels add with
squared row weights.  The exact level-resolved calculus therefore gives only a persistence
theorem: a common forbidden overlap at every admissible pair of cohort levels remains
forbidden after pooling.  It does not prove dissolution.  The explicit spherical calculation
below records the complementary biological mechanism: genetic structure shared by cohorts
survives mixing, whereas cohort-specific higher-order structure is diluted.

/-- The active sparse-LD correlation after pooling two environments with correlations `rho`
and `-rho`.  This is the biological name for the landscape parameter itself.

    Empirical status: UNTESTED. The pooling formula is arithmetic on the two
    environment correlations; what is untested is the modelling step before it, that an
    ancestry-environment mixture is described by two correlations of equal size and
    opposite sign. No dataset here bears on that. -/

At active correlation `4/5`, both signs lie beyond the golden threshold and have a negative

polynomial-time algorithm from absence of the gap. -/

the same active LD correlation, pooling leaves that correlation unchanged at every mixture
weight.  The proven gap-closing construction therefore uses opposite-sign LD, not diversity
alone. -/

/-! ## Multiple-merger genealogy: pairwise blindness -/

/-- **Pairwise diversity cannot identify a normalized multiple-merger regime.**  Every
probability-normalized merger law has pair-merger rate one, whereas the three-lineage rate is
its first merger-fraction moment.  The displayed point-mass pair is the smallest exact
witness: identical at two lineages and separated at three. -/

  pairwise_blind_three_lineage_separates_dirac

/-- **Speed-conditioned genealogy is identified at three lineages, not two.**  In the
normalized `Beta(1, β + 1)` chart the pair rate is identically one, while the inverse of the
three-lineage rate recovers `β` exactly.  This is the finite observable consequence of the
regular-variation speed-tilt theorem. -/

  ⟨speedTiltBetaMergerRate_two_two β,
    speedBiasParameterFromTripleRate_recovers β⟩

/-- **Why the regular-variation genealogy has no simultaneous disjoint mergers.**  At tail
scale `d`, a two-family pair-pair collision is smaller than a one-family pair collision by the
explicit factor `d (β + 1) / ((β + 2) (β + 3))`.  The factor is one order smaller in the
rare-family scale, not merely bounded by an unspecified error. -/

/-- Along every vanishing regular-variation tail scale, simultaneous two-family collisions
disappear on the pair-collision clock.  This is the biology-facing separation between the
single-event `Λ` limit here and the mass-partition `Ξ` limit needed for genuinely simultaneous
families. -/

/-- **The biology core consumes the marked successful-family measure itself.**  At zero tilt its
weighted pushforward is exactly the unconditioned genealogy measure, and for every merger size
the Bernoulli family-participation rate is the corresponding `Λ`-rate.  This is the formal
replacement for treating a coalescent measure alone as the universal branching-front object. -/

/-- **The speed-conditioned genealogy retains the response mark.**  This measurable-set formula
is the biology-facing version of `Λθ(dx) = x² ∫ exp(-θr) ν(dx,dr)`: it exposes the full marked
intensity rather than silently replacing it by its unconditioned fraction marginal. -/

/-- **But the speed-conditioned chart is not universal.**  The `Beta` interpolation is an
invariant of the front-displacement law, not a consequence of the unconditioned genealogy.  A
marked breakout measure whose displacement is linear in the family fraction has exactly the
same unconditioned Bolthausen--Sznitman limit and a different conditioned three-lineage rate,
so no deterministic time change relates the two charts.

The biological reading is a constraint on inference: fitting the `Beta` chart to
three-lineage data identifies the tilt parameter only if the displacement law is the
logarithmic one.  The chart is a model assumption about front response, not a fact about
multiple-merger genealogies. -/

/-- **And what the chart does rest on, exactly.**  The logarithmic displacement law is what
makes the tilt factor a power of the surviving fraction, and additive displacement noise
independent of the family fraction is absorbed by normalization.  These two identities are the
forward calculation; the following theorem supplies the exact transform-level converse. -/

/-! ## Sweep multiplicity: what allele-frequency data cannot decide -/

/-- **A hard sweep and a soft sweep with the same frequency trajectory leave different
genealogies.**

A beneficial allele reaching frequency `x` from a single origin, and the same allele reaching
`x` from two independent origins carrying `x/2` each, have identical allele-frequency
trajectories: same times, same increments, same endpoint.  No frequency statistic separates
them, at any sample size or sequencing depth, because there is nothing to separate.

Their genealogies differ twice over.  The soft sweep coalesces a sampled pair at half the rate,
so it leaves twice the diversity for the same frequency change -- which is why a diversity
level read against a frequency trajectory does not measure selection strength unless
multiplicity is already known.  And four sampled lineages can fall two-and-two into distinct
origin classes under the soft sweep, an event the hard sweep cannot produce at all.

The second fact is the usable one: it is a difference in the SHAPE of the genealogy, not its
rate, so no rescaling of time or effective size reproduces it. -/

/-- **The sample-size ladder for reading a selected genealogy.**

Two lineages see nothing: every normalized merger law has pairwise rate one, so heterozygosity
and mean pairwise coalescence time are blind to the regime.  Three lineages see the merger rate
and recover the tilt parameter exactly.  Four lineages are the first that can see how many
origins a sweep had, because two-and-two assignment into distinct origin classes is the
event that distinguishes multiplicity.

Read as a design constraint: a study powered on pairwise diversity cannot detect a selection
regime however large it is, and a study using three-lineage statistics can measure the rate but
still cannot tell one origin from several. -/

/-- **The sweep-origin count a frequency trajectory would have to supply, and cannot.**

The pioneer change of variables turns a reproductive-weight tail into the population-fraction
intensity and the frequency response into the logarithmic displacement law, so the whole
reduction rests on those two maps and nothing else.  Recording it here is what makes the
previous theorem a statement about a mechanism rather than about two arbitrary partitions. -/

when it descends along that label.  The target-only annotation descends; the source-adapted
quality does not.  So the quantity a cross-state criterion measures is a function of the pair
(target context, population), not of the target context — which is why no relabelling of the
target average recovers it. -/

/-! ## The adaptation time and the transport time are one time -/

/-- **A single-rate integrated autocorrelation time is the inverse-dissipation frontier
time.**

`DirichletTransfer.autocorrTime` is `Σ wᵢ / λᵢ`, the time the value signal stays informative;
`CirculationDefect.frontierTime` is `1 / s`, the time scale a transfer frontier runs on. At
one mode of unit weight they are the same number, and that is what puts the two layers of
this dictionary on one clock: the cost of adapting a readout to `θ(x)` is measured in the
units the transport frontier is measured in.

The link matters because `CirculationDefect` proves that a mixing diagnostic *understates*
`frontierTime` whenever the demography circulates, by the factor `1 + (a/s)²`. Through this
identity that understatement is an understatement of the adaptation time too, rather than a
fact about a separate quantity that happens to be written the same way. -/

/-! ## Conditional descent is the portability gate before prediction

The same score bin or ancestry summary can support different conditional phenotype laws in
different cohorts.  `FunctionalDescent` separates two biologically distinct failures:
interaction can disappear in either margin and reappear after refinement, while confounding can
be controlled by either informative variable and reappear after marginalization.  Thus the
choice of retained covariate is part of the portability theorem, not preprocessing notation. -/

/-- **The conditional-descent boundary is present in the biological core.**  Both finite
probability-law witnesses retain their complete order-theoretic statements.  Moreover, each
failure is already pairwise: the exact finite gluing theorem rules out a hidden global-selection
explanation.  Biologically, two cohorts disagree on a charged conditional section; the failure is
effect modification or confounding, not an off-support choice of conditional version. -/
