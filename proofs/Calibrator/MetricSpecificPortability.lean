# Metric-Specific Portability (Open Question 3)

This file formalizes Wang et al.'s Open Question 3: portability depends
on the prediction metric used. Different metrics (R², AUC, Brier, NRI,
calibration) can show different portability patterns for the same trait
and populations.

Key results:
1. R² vs AUC portability relationship
2. Calibration vs discrimination portability
3. Precision vs recall portability
4. Metric decomposition and cross-population behavior
5. Optimal metric choice for clinical applications

## R² Decomposition from First Principles

We derive the decomposition R² = discrimination × calibration from the
standard regression definition R² = 1 − SS_res/SS_tot, rather than
assuming it as a parameter structure.

### Setup
- Y is the observed outcome with variance Var(Y).
- Ŷ is the predicted value from a model.
- R² = 1 − SS_res/SS_tot = 1 − Var(Y − Ŷ)/Var(Y).
- By the law of total variance,
    Var(Y) = Var(E[Y|Ŷ]) + E[Var(Y|Ŷ)],
  so R² = Var(E[Y|Ŷ])/Var(Y) when we use the population version.

### Decomposition
Write E[Y|Ŷ] = f(Ŷ), the calibration function.
- **Discrimination** captures how spread out the predictions are
  relative to outcome variance: disc = Var(Ŷ)/Var(Y).
- **Calibration** captures how well the calibration function f
  preserves the variance of Ŷ: cal = Var(f(Ŷ))/Var(Ŷ).

Then: R² = Var(E[Y|Ŷ])/Var(Y)
         = Var(f(Ŷ))/Var(Y)
         = [Var(f(Ŷ))/Var(Ŷ)] × [Var(Ŷ)/Var(Y)]
         = cal × disc.

When perfectly calibrated, f = id, so cal = 1 and R² = disc.

section R2Decomposition

/-- Algebraic representation of the components entering the R² decomposition.

    All quantities are real-valued summary statistics computed from the joint
    distribution of (Y, Ŷ).  The structure records:
    • `varY`      — Var(Y), total outcome variance,
    • `varYhat`   — Var(Ŷ), variance of the predictor,
    • `varCondE`  — Var(E[Y|Ŷ]) = Var(f(Ŷ)), explained variance,
    where f is the calibration function f(ŷ) = E[Y | Ŷ = ŷ].

    From these three quantities every other object (R², discrimination,
    calibration) is a ratio, and the key factorization is purely algebraic. -/

    R² = Var(E[Y|Ŷ]) / Var(Y).

    This is equivalent to 1 − SS_res/SS_tot when SS_res is evaluated
    at the population level, because
      SS_res/SS_tot = Var(Y − E[Y|Ŷ])/Var(Y)

    Measures how well the calibration function preserves the predictor's

    perfectly calibrated but the target loses calibration, then:

    - the literal population AUC is preserved exactly;
    - the absolute AUC portability gap is exactly `0`;
    - the `R²` portability ratio equals the residual target calibration;
    - the `R²` portability loss `1 - R²_target / R²_source` is strictly positive.

    This states the metric comparison directly on the repository's actual

## Calibration vs Discrimination

Calibration (predicted risk = observed risk) and discrimination
(ability to separate cases from controls) can degrade differently
across populations.

section CalibrationVsDiscrimination

/-- **At fixed drift in the neutral benchmark, exact liability AUC is preserved
while CITL shifts exactly with the mean-score offset.**
    This theorem formalizes the intended metric split on the repository's
    actual metrics:

    - discrimination is measured by exact liability-threshold AUC;
    - calibration is measured by calibration-in-the-large (CITL).

    If source and target have the same `fst`, then the exact liability transport
    map gives exactly the same AUC. If the target mean prediction is shifted by an
    additive offset `δ`, then CITL shifts by exactly `-δ`. This is the precise
    fixed-`fst` statement behind "rank-based discrimination can be preserved
    while calibration is lost." -/

/-- **THE DISCRIMINATION CONJUNCT REMOVED FROM THE TWO THEOREMS BELOW WAS VACUOUS, AND
THIS IS WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE SAID.**

The deleted conjunct was

`presentDayEqualVarianceGaussianAUC V_A V_E fst =
   presentDayEqualVarianceGaussianAUC V_A V_E fst`

and it was proved by `rfl`, because those two names denote **the same function**:
`presentDayEqualVarianceGaussianAUC` delegates to
`presentDayEqualVarianceGaussianAUC`, which delegates to `presentDayEqualVarianceGaussianAUC`, of
which `presentDayEqualVarianceGaussianAUC` is a one-line alias. It was `f x = f x` wearing
two names, and it would have held equally well had AUC been wildly *not* preserved. Nothing
in reading the statement revealed this; the name structure concealed it.

Note what did **not** help: the docstring on `presentDayEqualVarianceGaussianAUC`
had already been corrected to say "equal-variance Gaussian" and to record the `-0.068`
bias. A docstring cannot repair a statement built out of identifiers.

The substantive claim the prose was reaching for is below, and it needs a hypothesis: the
equal-variance AUC depends on heritability and drift **only through the attenuated signal
variance**, so any two configurations agreeing there have equal AUC. That is why "same
drift, same AUC" holds, and unlike the deleted conjunct it can fail — supply configurations
with different attenuated signal variance and the conclusion goes away. -/

/-- **Benchmark discrimination can be preserved while calibration is lost.**

    Discrimination half: if two configurations agree in attenuated signal variance -- which
    is what "sharing the same drift level" delivers -- the equal-variance AUC is unchanged.
    This is a hypothesis-carrying claim, not an identity: see
    `neutralAF_benchmark_auc_depends_only_on_attenuated_signal` for why a form provable by
    `rfl` here would be empty.

    Calibration half: if the source is calibrated in the large and the target mean
    prediction is shifted by a nonzero `δ`, target absolute CITL becomes strictly worse.
    This half was always substantive and is unchanged.

    The pairing is the point, and only now does it have two working halves: discrimination
    can survive exactly the perturbation that destroys calibration, so reporting AUC alone
    hides the failure. Note also that this is the **equal-variance** AUC; on a dichotomised
    trait the discrimination half would have to be restated with
    `liabilityThresholdAUCFromExplainedR2` at a named prevalence, where preservation is a
    stronger claim because the conditional variances differ. -/

    is measured over 4000 to 40000 independent replicate estimates. Two
    exponential families with different Fisher information, so `I` is not a
    relabelled variance -- Gaussian location at `σ² = 4` (`I = 1/4`) and
    Bernoulli at `p = 0.3` (`I = 1/(p(1-p)) = 4.76`):

/-! ### The other half of a deployment budget, and the one that binds

`requiredEffectiveSampleSizeForTraceMSE` is a budget for *estimating target parameters*:
`(d/I)/tau`, which grows like `1/tau` as the target tightens. That is not the only budget a
deployment of the curve-prior dissolution has to meet, and it is not the binding one.

`Calibrator.FoldedSpectrum.RecoveryAttenuation.panels_suffice_iff` supplies the other:
averaging `B` order-free panels per cohort attains reliability `tau` **iff**
`B >= c*tau/(p*(1-tau))`. These are budgets for different quantities and neither implies
the other -- one is per-sample Fisher information for a parameter vector, the other is
replication of a variance estimate -- so the composite below is a conjunction, not a
derivation of one from the other. Do not collapse it into one bound.

**What the pairing shows is the asymmetry in `tau`.** The Fisher budget carries `1/tau`;
the panel budget carries `1/(1-tau)`. The first is bounded as the target tightens and the
second is not: each additional nine of reliability costs another factor of ten in panels.
So a design that budgets only along the Fisher axis will underprovision, and it will do so
by more the better the design is meant to be. The measured run reached reliability `0.153`
at `B = 16`, which puts `c/p` near `88` and the `tau = 0.8` requirement near **350 panels
per cohort** -- two orders of magnitude above what was tried.

This is why the dissolution is not yet usable, and the reason is worth stating precisely:
not that the population identity is false -- it is exact -- but that the reliability it
needs was never budgeted for. -/

/-- **A deployment must clear both budgets, and they are independent conditions.**

The estimation budget in effective sample size and the replication budget in panels per
cohort, stated as one iff so that neither can be quietly dropped. The panel half is

/-- **The panel budget is unbounded in the reliability target; the Fisher budget is not.**

For any panel count `M` however large there is a reliability target below one that needs
more than `M` panels. That is the `1/(1-tau)` blow-up, and it is the formal content of "each
additional nine costs a factor of ten". Nothing analogous holds for
`requiredEffectiveSampleSizeForTraceMSE`, whose dependence on its own target is `1/tau` and
therefore bounded as the target tightens toward its best value.

The design reading: reliability, not per-sample information, is the constraint that decides
whether this method is affordable. -/

    1. at any fixed effective sample size, the Fisher trace-MSE lower bound is

## Precision vs Recall in PGS Risk Stratification

Clinical PGS use involves classifying individuals as high-risk
or normal-risk. Precision and recall can have different portability.

/-- **Positive predictive value at zero prevalence, named.** With no cases in the population
there are no positive calls to be right about and the PPV is undefined; numerator and denominator
both vanish and Lean returns `0`. So a PERFECT test -- unit sensitivity, unit specificity --
reports that every positive call it makes is wrong. The failure is worst exactly where screening
programmes operate, at low prevalence, and it is indistinguishable from a test that genuinely
never calls a true positive. Consumers must require `0 < prevalence`. -/

/-- **A perfectly specific test has predictive value one wherever it fires.**

At `specificity = 1` the false-positive term vanishes identically and the predictive value is one
at every prevalence, however small. That is the endpoint which fixes the form: the dependence on
prevalence is carried entirely by the false-positive term, so a body that let prevalence enter the
numerator would still be increasing in sensitivity and in prevalence, and would fail here.

It is also the reason the PPV portability gap is driven by specificity rather than sensitivity.
Two populations differing only in prevalence have equal predictive value when specificity is one,
and the gap opens only as specificity falls away from it. -/

/-! ### Calibrating one score across a continuum of ancestries

WHAT THE INDEX AND THE COVARIATE ARE. This is not optional bookkeeping; the wrong reading makes
every theorem below say `0 = 0`.

The COVARIATE is the SCORE. The INDEX is ancestry position. `π` is the ancestry posterior GIVEN
the score, and `η i` is ancestry `i`'s risk at that score. Each ancestry has its own calibration
curve in the score, the score's distribution genuinely varies with ancestry, and the drift is how
each ancestry's risk curve departs from the pooled curve.

The reading that destroys everything is index = principal-component position WHILE the components
are also regressors. Then the covariate determines the index, the ancestry posterior collapses to
a point mass, and `pointMass_driftDefect_zero` below shows the defect is identically zero. The
framework requires the index to be HIDDEN BEHIND the covariate, not measured alongside it.

A polygenic score deployed across many ancestries faces two calibration demands. INDEX-WISE:
calibrated within each ancestry separately. POOLED: calibrated on the mixture. The applied
literature treats these as competing objectives and reports a pooled-versus-worst-group gap as
evidence of the conflict.

Under squared loss they do not compete. `indexwiseLoss_eq_defect_add_sq` decomposes the
ancestry-averaged calibration loss into an irreducible term and the squared pooled residual,

    indexwiseLoss π η v = driftDefect π η + (pooledConditional π η - v) ^ 2

from which three things follow at once. The index-wise optimum IS the pooled-calibrated
predictor; the pooled residual there is exactly zero; and the achievable pairs trace a parabola,
not a frontier. Buying pooled miscalibration never buys index-wise accuracy.

The tension in the applied literature is real, but it is in the WORST-ancestry norm rather than
the averaged one. `pooledOptimum_worse_in_worst_ancestry` exhibits two ancestries at unequal
mixture weight where the pooled-calibrated value is strictly worse for the worse-served group
than a value that is itself pooled-miscalibrated. Averaging over ancestries and protecting the
worst ancestry are different objectives; averaging and pooling are not.

`driftDefect` is what no predictor removes: the dispersion of the ancestry-specific conditional
about its pooled average. It is simultaneously the unavoidable squared-loss regret, so the
calibration obstruction and the prediction regret are one number rather than two.

`pooledConditional_does_not_identify_drift` is the transport limit. Two drift fields with the same
pooled average differ at an individual ancestry, so pooled data cannot separate them. When
ancestries share covariate structure and differ only in the conditional, extrapolating to an
unmeasured ancestry returns nothing beyond the pooled average -- which is the sharpest statement
available about why a score fitted in one population does not transport to another by
recalibration alone.

Empirical status: DERIVED. The decomposition and the witnesses are exhibited; the mixture weights
and ancestry-specific conditionals of a real deployment are unmeasured inputs.

that posterior is a point mass -- which is exactly what happens if the ancestry coordinate is

trivially, and every theorem in this section degenerates to `0 = 0`.

Stated so the degeneracy is visible rather than discovered later. It is the precondition for
reading any of the results as saying something about a deployment. -/

/-! #### Resolution: what refining the index buys, and what it cannot

Splitting the ancestry index into cells and calibrating per cell resolves part of the drift and
leaves the rest. The two parts are the between-cell and within-cell components of the drift
energy, and they sum to the total: refining moves energy from unresolved to resolved and creates
none. That is the finite form of the statement that the residual removed by refining is exactly
the drift energy the refinement resolves.

Two consequences, both witnessed concretely below on three ancestries at risks `0, 1, 2`.

Merging two ancestries into one cell strictly REDUCES the resolved energy, from `2/3` to `1/2`.
So resolved energy is monotone under refinement, and a coarser deployment -- calibrating on
continental groupings rather than finer ancestry -- resolves strictly less drift. It cannot be
made up elsewhere.

And the excess over the floor is exactly quadratic in how far the predictor sits from the pooled
conditional, with no linear term. That is why an ERROR IN THE INFERRED ANCESTRY GEOMETRY costs
only second order: the true optimum already annihilates the pooled direction, so the first-order
term that would otherwise appear is identically zero.

/-! #### The ancestry coordinate that explains the most variation can explain none of the drift

The drift operator sends a weight function on the ancestry continuum to the drift it captures.
Ordering ancestry coordinates by how much drift energy each carries is therefore the ordering that
minimises unresolved drift for a given number of coordinates.

Principal components order the same continuum by how much GENOTYPE variance each explains. Nothing
connects the two orderings, and the witness below shows they can be not merely different but
opposed: four ancestries, two candidate coordinates, and the coordinate that carries all of the
score variation carries none of the drift while the coordinate that carries all of the drift
carries none of the score variation.

So "use the leading principal components as ancestry coordinates" is not a neutral choice. It
optimises a criterion unrelated to calibration, and the direction it selects first can be exactly
the direction along which the risk curve does not move.

Two further consequences, which follow from the drift operator being built out of the drift
itself. The optimal coordinates are SCORE- AND TRAIT-SPECIFIC: change the score or the trait and
the operator changes, so there is no one universal ancestry map. And estimating them needs
phenotypes across the ancestry range, so the basis is supervised and does not extrapolate. What
`excess_is_exactly_quadratic` buys is that getting the basis slightly wrong costs the square of
the error rather than the error, provided the constant coordinate is always retained.

/-! #### The atomic within/between split

The witness above shows merging two ancestries loses resolved energy. The identity below is why,
in general and exactly. For two ancestries at weights `w₁, w₂` carrying risks `a, b`, write `c`
for their weighted mean. Then against ANY reference `m`,

    w₁(a-m)² + w₂(b-m)² = (w₁+w₂)(c-m)² + w₁w₂/(w₁+w₂) · (a-b)²

The first term on the right is what a deployment that merges the two ancestries can still see;
the second is what it loses, and it is the weighted squared risk gap between them. The loss is
zero exactly when the two ancestries carry the same risk, which is when merging them was
harmless.

That is the whole content of resolution monotonicity: refinement resolves the pairwise risk gaps,
and coarsening returns them to the irreducible floor. -/

/-! #### The obstruction is drift VISIBLE TO THE SCORE'S BINS, not total effect heterogeneity

The irreducible defect is the variance across ancestry of the BIN-AVERAGED risk, not of the
pointwise risk. Those come apart, and the distinction decides whether the portability floor is
estimable and possibly small or a restatement of "effect sizes differ across populations".

Below, two ancestries whose risks at a fine covariate resolution are `4/5` and `1/5` -- a large
pointwise disagreement -- average to `1/2` in both ancestries once binned. At the bin resolution
the defect is exactly zero: a score whose level sets average the drift away carries no irreducible
obstruction, however large the underlying effect heterogeneity. Sharpening the bins reveals it.

That is co-monotonicity in its operative form. Resolution and defect move together, so a claim to
have built a maximally discriminative score that is also calibrated across ancestry is a claim
that the drift is invisible to that score's level sets -- which is testable, on the fitted curves,

/-! #### Resolution does not order the defect

`refining_reveals_drift` compares a binning with a REFINEMENT of that binning, and along a nested
chain the comparison is the conditional-Jensen one: coarsening can only shrink the visible defect.
The tempting generalisation -- that a predictor with more resolution carries more defect -- is
false, and the following instance refutes it outright.

Two independent fair bits `U` and `V`, an index taking two values with equal weight, and

    η(U, V) = 1/2 + (1/10) * sign U + t * (1/10) * sign V.

A predictor resolving `U` sees the whole non-drifting part and none of the drifting part: it has
positive resolution and zero defect. A predictor resolving `V` sees only the drifting part, which
averages away over the index: it has zero resolution and positive defect. So one predictor has
STRICTLY more resolution and STRICTLY less defect than the other, and no co-monotone frontier
exists over unrelated predictors.

The two are incomparable as σ-algebras, which is exactly the hypothesis `refining_reveals_drift`
supplies and this instance withholds.

/-! #### Superposition of landscapes lives in `LandscapeSuperposition`

Pooling cohorts is a weighted sum of per-cohort landscapes, which is the shape
`indexwiseLoss` above already has, so a version of that theory was drafted here.
It is gone: `proofs/Calibrator/LandscapeSuperposition.lean` has the same material
and more.

That file carries the decomposition of the pooled near-optimal set over feasible
level allocations, the overlap inclusion it implies, the persistence lemma in both
set and interval form, the vertex-of-the-simplex counterexample showing the
decomposition is not uniform in the weights, and the spherical calibration
arithmetic -- two barriered summands whose equal mixture is barrier-free. On that
last one it proves the mixture certificate positive across the whole overlap
range rather than at a single point, which the version here did not.

The connection worth keeping in mind from this module: the identity's usable half
is one-directional, and it is the same asymmetry `driftDefect` has. A barrier
excluded by some cohort at every split of the target is excluded by the pooled
fit; that pooling DISSOLVES a barrier does not follow, and needs configurations
built at the intermediate overlaps.
-/


/-- **The pooled calibration target decomposes into per-ancestry loss budgets.**

`indexwiseLoss` is a nonnegatively weighted sum of per-ancestry squared errors, so
it is a superposition landscape in the sense of `LandscapeSuperposition`, and that
file's decomposition specialises here. A prediction meets a pooled calibration
target exactly when there is a way of dividing the loss budget across ancestries
that the prediction meets ancestry by ancestry -- and the division witnessing it
is the prediction's own per-ancestry error.

Nonnegativity of the mixture weights is what makes the reverse direction true. -/

/-- **A score no budget split can rescue is rejected by the pooled fit.**

The usable half of the decomposition, in the direction the corpus cares about. If
for every division of the loss budget across ancestries some ancestry is over its
share, then the pooled objective rejects the prediction too. Pooling cohorts
cannot rescue a score that fails ancestry-wise under every allocation.

The converse does not follow and is not stated: that pooling ADMITS a prediction
no single allocation admits would need a prediction constructed at the
intermediate errors, which no inclusion of this shape supplies. It is the same
asymmetry `driftDefect_le_indexwiseLoss` has -- a floor that transfers upward and
not down. -/

/-! #### Heterogeneous cohorts can remove a barrier that each cohort alone has

The superposition decomposition above says a barrier persists unless some
allocation satisfies every cohort at once. This records the population geometry
where that escape is available, and how much minority data it takes.

For a design whose covariance couples the planted support to a decoy support with
strength `α`, the population loss at overlap fraction `x` away from the truth is
`φ_q(x) = x(1 - qx) / (1 - qx(1-x))` with `q = α²`. A barrier exists exactly when
that profile has an interior maximum, which happens exactly when `1 - 3q + q²`
turns negative -- so the transition is at the root of that quadratic.

The root is the golden-ratio conjugate squared, and the transition in `α` is the
golden-ratio conjugate itself. Mixing two cohorts with couplings `±ρ` in
proportion `π` gives an average coupling `ρ(2π - 1)`, so a minority fraction of
`½(1 - ρ_c/ρ)` suffices to bring the mixture below the transition. At the
strongest possible coupling that is `(3 - √5)/4`, a little over nineteen per cent.

The biological reading is the one the corpus cares about: a barrier created by
linkage between a causal locus and a decoy in one ancestry can be removed by
including a second ancestry in which the linkage has the opposite sign, and the
required minority fraction is bounded away from a half. It is not a statement
about better conditioning -- the eigenvalue extremes and the coherence can be
held fixed while this happens.

per cent. Bounded away from a half: the minority cohort does not have to be

/-! #### The sign restriction the nineteen per cent depends on

The construction above mixes couplings `ρ` and `-ρ`, and it closes the barrier by
passing the mixed coupling through zero at `π = 1/2`. That is a cancellation of
opposite signs, not an averaging of magnitudes, and the distinction decides
whether the minority share means anything for study design: real ancestries
usually differ in the *magnitude* of their linkage correlations, not the sign.
Sign flips occur -- a variant arising on a different haplotype background -- but
they are not the typical case.

The two results below say exactly that: the mixed coupling is the convex
combination of the two cohort couplings, and it reaches zero only at the balance
point. The complementary half -- that same-sign cohorts keep their sign under
every mixture, so no mixture reaches zero -- is
`sameSignAncestryPooling_preservesActiveCorrelation` in `LandscapeSuperposition`,
and is not restated here.

So the demonstrated mechanism is narrower than "diversity helps", and whether
same-sign cohorts of differing magnitude can also close a barrier is not settled
by this construction. -/

/-! #### A direction invisible to the pooled design is invisible to every cohort

The exact-degeneracy counterpart, and it runs the other way from the barrier
result. Pooling cannot manufacture identifiability: if a coefficient direction
carries no signal in the pooled design, it carries none in any cohort. What
pooling does is the converse -- a direction invisible in one cohort can be visible
in the pool, because the pooled quadratic form is a nonnegatively weighted sum and
vanishes only when every term does.

So heterogeneous cohorts shrink the exactly-unidentifiable set by intersecting
it, which is the precise sense in which adding an ancestry can resolve an
ambiguity that no single ancestry resolves. -/

/-! #### Heterogeneity fattens the lower tail, so barriers close by filling not deleting

The intuition that pooling cohorts removes a barrier by DELETING the distant
cluster is backwards, and the correction is a one-line concavity argument.

The large-deviation rate for an anomalously small residual is built from
`log (1 + 2λs)` in the per-cohort residual scales `s`. That function is concave,
so a mixture of cohorts has rate at most that of a single cohort at the average
scale. Holding the average covariance fixed, heterogeneity cannot make a
candidate's anomalously good fit exponentially less likely -- it makes it at
least as likely.

So at fixed average covariance a barrier closes by FILLING the intermediate
region, not by removing the far cluster. That matches the decomposition above,
whose usable half certifies persistence and says nothing about dissolution: the
dissolution direction needs configurations built at intermediate overlaps, and
this says the tails there are if anything fatter than the homogeneous
comparison would suggest.

/-- **Two cohorts have a smaller rate than one cohort at their average scale.**

Concavity of the logarithm, applied at the residual scales. `π` and `1 - π` are

average. A smaller rate means a fatter lower tail. -/

For a demographic history with at most `K` epochs, the sharp stability exponent
for recovering it from the expected site-frequency spectrum is `1 / (2K - 3)`.
Read through the sample size the spectrum comes from, that constant is not an
arbitrary function of `K`.

A sample of `n = 2K - 2` haplotypes has exactly `n - 1 = 2K - 3` spectrum entries,
so the exponent is the reciprocal of the number of entries available. Each extra
epoch demands two more samples AND costs two in the exponent: the model's
complexity and the inverse problem's ill-posedness move together, and no
sampling effort separates them.

Two epochs are Lipschitz-stable. Three already have cube-root instability, four

/-! #### Drift invisible to genotype is irreducible by any amount of genotyping

The defect splits into a part measurable with respect to the genotype-distribution structure and a
part orthogonal to it. Only the first is attackable by more reference panels, deeper sequencing,
or better ancestry inference: the second is invisible to every genotype-measurable statistic, so
no quantity of genotype data touches it.

The witness is two ancestries whose genotype distributions coincide -- so any genotype-based
method assigns them the same value, and any inferred ancestry coordinate merges them -- carrying
different conditional risks. At the genotype-visible resolution the defect is zero. The true
defect is positive. The gap is irreducible.

This is the formal shape of the binding empirical objection to the whole extrapolation programme.
Harpak and colleagues report that variation in individual-level prediction accuracy is only weakly
predicted by genetic distance and is explained comparably well by socioeconomic measures. If that
is so, a large part of the drift field sits in exactly the orthogonal component witnessed here,
and the fill-distance machinery -- which prices extrapolation in a metric induced by the GENOTYPE
marginals -- is pricing the wrong thing. More diverse genotyping shrinks the attackable part and
leaves the rest untouched.

The theory gives the accounting and not the causal decomposition. It says which portion of a
measured portability gap is in principle reachable by genetic data; it does not say how large
that portion is, and the empirical claim is that it may be the smaller one.

/-! #### A decision loss wants a median, not the mean that meta-analysis estimates

Under squared loss the single best target is the ancestry-weighted MEAN, which is what a
fixed-effects meta-analysis across cohorts estimates. Under a threshold decision loss it is a
weighted MEDIAN of the ancestry-conditional risks. When the ancestry distribution is skewed --
and a GWAS-derived `π` is heavily skewed -- these are different numbers, so the quantity the
literature estimates is not the quantity a deployment decision needs.

The witness below has three ancestries at weights `2/5, 3/10, 3/10` carrying risks `0, 0, 1`. The
weighted mean is `3/10`; the weighted median is `0`. Absolute loss at `0` is `3/10`, and at the
mean it is `21/50` -- strictly worse. The pooled mean is not merely a different summary, it is
suboptimal for the decision.

/-! #### Unequal per-ancestry sample sizes inflate the effective resolution

Splitting the index into `k` cells and estimating within each costs an estimation term
proportional to the EFFECTIVE cell count `N * ∑ πᵢ / nᵢ`, not to `k`.  For equal cell
weights this is minimized by equal allocation and any departure costs a harmonic factor.  For
unequal weights the square-root law proved below replaces proportional allocation.

The equal-weight two-cell case is stated first: the penalty is at least four, attained by equal
allocation, and grows without bound as the split becomes lopsided.  The subsequent theorems then
separate posterior-weighted and worst-ancestry recruitment objectives.

/-! #### Recruitment depends on the deployment objective

The preceding equal-weight witness does not justify proportional recruitment for unequal ancestry
weights.  For the stated `L²(π)` estimation term `∑ πᵢ / nᵢ`, the exact two-cell lower
bound is attained by square-root (Neyman) allocation, `nᵢ ∝ √πᵢ`.  A worst-ancestry
objective is different again: with equal per-sample noise it is minimized by equal precision,
independently of the deployment mixture.  Thus an objective must be fixed before a recruitment
rule can be called optimal.

/-! #### Resolution monotonicity in general, not just on a witness

The merge witness shows coarsening loses drift energy in one instance; the atomic split shows
exactly what a two-way merge costs. The general statement is that a CELL of any size, collapsed
to its weighted mean, retains at most the energy it had, and the shortfall is the within-cell
dispersion.

This is weighted Cauchy-Schwarz, and it is what makes resolution monotone under arbitrary
refinement rather than only under pairwise merges: any coarsening is a composition of cell
collapses, and each one loses energy.

Biologically it says the same thing at every granularity. A deployment that calibrates on
continental groupings resolves at most what one calibrating on finer ancestry resolves, whatever
the groupings are, and the deficit is the spread of risk inside each grouping. -/

/-! #### Which decision losses survive the drift

A threshold decision loss at `τ` charges only for outcomes on the wrong side of `τ`. If every
ancestry-specific risk lies on one side of the threshold, the drift moves no decision and the
loss is unaffected: the score is simultaneously optimal for that loss at every ancestry. If the
threshold falls strictly inside the range of ancestry-specific risks, no single prediction is
optimal for all of them.

That is the exact criterion. A clinical threshold set outside the spread of ancestry-specific
risks transports; one set inside it does not, however well the score is calibrated.

/-! #### Why a threshold inside the drift range admits no single decision

`aboveThresholdMass_eq_zero` and `belowThresholdMass_eq_zero` say a threshold outside the range of
ancestry-specific risks is untouched. The reason a threshold INSIDE the range cannot be served is
sharper than "the regret is positive": the two ancestries fall on opposite sides of it, so the
decision the loss recommends is literally different at each, and no single prediction is the
right decision at both.

That is the deployment question, stated exactly. It is not "is the score calibrated" but "does
the spread of ancestry-specific risk at my operating point straddle my clinical cutoff". The
first is an aggregate diagnostic; the second is decidable from the fitted per-ancestry curves and
is the one that determines whether the cutoff transports. -/

/-! #### The score's own distribution cannot see how it aligns with ancestry

`pooledConditional_does_not_identify_drift` says the pooled conditional cannot see drift across
ancestries. This is the same failure one layer up, in the metric: the DISTRIBUTION of a score's
values across a population does not determine how those values are arranged relative to ancestry
distance.

Three ancestries at metric positions `0, 1, 3`, equally weighted, and a score taking the values
`0, 1, 2`. Permuting which ancestry receives which value leaves the score's distribution exactly
unchanged, and the ancestry geometry exactly unchanged, while the alignment energy moves from
`10/3` to `2`. So no functional of the score's marginal distribution -- not its mean, variance,
quantiles, or full histogram -- can detect alignment.

/-! #### A rare ancestry is not proportionately harmless

The drift defect is an `L²` quantity, and the functional built from it moves like the SQUARE ROOT
of a subgroup's mass, not like the mass. So the standard dismissal -- "that ancestry is one per
cent of the sample, so it can move a global statistic by at most one per cent" -- is wrong by a
square root, and wrong in the direction that understates the damage.

Concretely: a population that is `1 - ε` one ancestry and `ε` another, whose conditionals differ
by one, has drift defect `ε (1 - ε)`. The mixture was perturbed by `ε`; the calibration functional
`√defect` moved by `√(ε(1-ε)) ≍ √ε`. No Lipschitz constant in the mass exists, and the theorem
below says so in the form that needs no square roots: the defect strictly exceeds the square of
the rare group's share.

This is the exact mechanism behind the failure of any uniform-Lipschitz claim for a variance-type
decoration functional: on the exceptional set of mass `ε` the values differ by `O(1)`, which
contributes `O(ε)` to a SQUARED quantity and therefore `O(√ε)` to the functional itself.

RENAMED off `_at_reference_point`. The old name claimed to pin the body's scale,
and a statement of `0` cannot: `c · 0 = 0` for every `c`, so every rescaling of
this gap satisfies it. The vanishing is nonetheless real content — it says the
gap is a function of the DIFFERENCE between the two prevalences and not of their
level, which is exactly the property that makes it a portability gap rather than
a second copy of the PPV.

Note the quantifiers are what give it its strength: it holds for every
`sensitivity` and `specificity`, so it also says the operating point cannot
manufacture a gap on its own. That is worth keeping and is not what a reference
evaluation is for.

The scale is pinned separately, by `ppvPortabilityGap_at_reference_point` below,

Between them a fractional multiple `c < 1` satisfied everything. This fixes it.

At `sensitivity = 1` and `specificity = 1/2` the PPV is
`prev / (prev + (1-prev)/2)`, giving `1/3` at `prev = 1/5` and `2/3` at
`prev = 1/2`, so the gap is `1/3`. The two orders are stated together on purpose,
and between them they reject three different wrong readings rather than only a
scale factor:

* any multiple `c ≠ 1` of the body gives `c/3`;
* dropping the absolute value gives `-1/3` on the second conjunct, since there
  the target PPV is the smaller one -- which is why both orders are needed and

This is the whole empirical content of the metric split: at fixed sensitivity and
specificity, PPV is prevalence-dependent and its portability gap cannot be zero. The
companion claim — that sensitivity's gap *is* zero — is not proved here and is not
provable here; it is `sensitivityPortabilityGap_self`, an identity, and holds because
sensitivity is defined without reference to prevalence. Keeping the two apart is the
point: one is a fact about `metricPPV`, the other is a fact about an argument list.

**Do not restate this as `sensitivityPortabilityGap se se < ppvPortabilityGap …`.** That

## Metric Choice Affects Clinical Decision-Making

Different metrics lead to different clinical decisions, so metric-
specific portability has direct practical consequences.

/-- **Screening PPV shifts even when case-finding sensitivity is unchanged.**
    Under a pure prevalence shift with identical sensitivity and specificity, the PPV

    cases.

/-! ### What the metric split is, and is not

This module's headline is that metric choice changes the portability verdict, and
`different_uses_different_metrics` is the exhibit. The Gaussian level-set collapse of
`Calibrator.FoldedSpectrum` sharpens that claim, and in doing so narrows it.

**The collapse.** Every *level-set functional* -- any threshold-based readout metric:
sensitivity, specificity, any exceedance probability, any quantile -- factors through
exactly two numbers of the transferred pair, the correlation drop and the variance ratio
(`LevelSetCoordinates`). So two deployments whose readouts agree in those two coordinates
agree in **every** threshold metric at once (`levelSet_metrics_agree_of_coords_eq`). No
choice among threshold metrics can separate them.

**What that does to the headline.** Prevalence is not one of the two coordinates. It is a
property of the outcome marginal, not of the readout. `metricPPV` reads it; sensitivity and
specificity do not. So the split this module exhibits is **not** a disagreement between
metrics at fixed readout -- the collapse forbids that -- it is the difference between a
metric that reads prevalence and metrics that do not.

That is a real narrowing, and it is the useful form for a reader deciding what to report:
holding the readout fixed, swapping one threshold metric for another cannot reverse a
portability verdict. To get a reversal you need either a prevalence shift (this module's
route) or the two coordinates to order oppositely
(`FoldedSpectrum.no_levelSet_reversal_of_aligned_coordinates`, the "only if" half). Metric
choice on its own is not a mechanism.

The theorem below states exactly this and no more. Note which parts come from where: the
first two conjuncts are the collapse and are **not provable in this file**; the last two are
this file's own `metricPPV` facts. -/

/-- A screening deployment: the two readout-side coordinates a threshold metric can see,
plus the prevalence, which is outcome-side and which the collapse does not contain. -/
structure ScreeningDeployment where
  /-- The readout-side coordinates: correlation drop and variance ratio. -/
  readout : LevelSetCoordinates
  /-- Outcome-side base rate. Deliberately **not** part of `readout`. -/
  prevalence : ℝ

/-- **Two deployments sharing a readout and differing only in prevalence.**

The result below is that everything separating a pair of deployments here is a
prevalence effect; stated over the class alone it is a conditional about objects
none of which had been exhibited. This is the pair the statement is about, built
so that the shared readout is shared BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by hypothesis
-- which is the point, since the readout is what threshold metrics factor
through and the prevalence is what they do not.

    Empirical status: NOT AN EMPIRICAL CLAIM -- a pair of deployment records. The
    claim with content is that real source and target deployments differ this
    way, which this does not assert. -/
def ScreeningDeployment.atPrevalence (readout : LevelSetCoordinates)
    (prevalence : ℝ) : ScreeningDeployment where
  readout := readout
  prevalence := prevalence

of the split result is discharged rather than assumed for this family. -/
theorem ScreeningDeployment.atPrevalence_readout_eq (readout : LevelSetCoordinates)
    (prevalence prevalence' : ℝ) :
    (ScreeningDeployment.atPrevalence readout prevalence).readout =
      (ScreeningDeployment.atPrevalence readout prevalence').readout := rfl

/-- **The metric split is a prevalence effect, not a metric-choice effect.**

`sens` and `spec` are any threshold metrics of the readout, i.e. any level-set functionals
of the two coordinates. Given two deployments with the *same* readout coordinates:

* they agree in sensitivity and in specificity -- and this is the part that needs
  `Calibrator.FoldedSpectrum`, since it holds for *every* level-set functional at once, not
  because of anything about these two in particular;
* at equal prevalence they therefore agree in PPV as well, so no threshold metric separates
  them at all;
* and a strict prevalence increase strictly raises PPV, which is the split
  `different_uses_different_metrics` reports.

Read together: everything that moves here moves because prevalence moved. Delete
`FoldedSpectrum` and the first conjunct has no proof.

**SCOPE, NARROWED AGAINST MEASUREMENT: this is about DISCRIMINATION metrics, not
"threshold metrics" in general, and it is FALSE for proper scoring rules.**

Murphy's decomposition is `Brier = reliability - resolution + uncertainty`. Resolution and
AUC both collapse onto `(R², prevalence)`, so the statement above covers them — but
**reliability is calibration, and it is a free third coordinate that neither readout
coordinate sees.**

Demonstrated by holding `R²` and prevalence fixed and varying only the score-to-probability
map through strictly monotone maps, which by construction cannot change any ranking:

* AUC spread **exactly 0.00**;
* resolution spread **exactly 0.00**;
* Brier spread **0.0162**, of which **0.0162 is the reliability term**.

The same split appears in the `sims/` data: `R²` alone explains `94.6%` of within-cell AUC
variance and only `67%` of Brier.

So this theorem is right about AUC, sensitivity, specificity and PPV, and **wrong about
Brier, the log score, and every proper scoring rule** — each carries a reliability term
invisible to both coordinates. A monotone recalibration moves a proper scoring rule while
leaving every quantity in this theorem's conclusion fixed. -/

## Metric-specific portability of the marker panel itself: the AR(1) frontier

Open Question 3 asks which *metric* a score is portable in.  Everything above
holds the marker panel fixed and varies the metric.  This section varies the
panel and finds the same phenomenon one level down: the panel construction step
— LD pruning or clumping — is itself a choice of metric, and it is not neutral
between the two things a panel is used for.

`Calibrator.ProjectionShiftBounds` proves the general statement: among relaxed
rank-`k` reductions of a background covariance, the variance-greedy one
simultaneously maximises reconstruction efficiency
(`topVariance_maximizes_reconstruction`) and minimises detection efficiency
(`topVariance_minimizes_detection`).  LD pruning is variance-greedy by
construction: it keeps one representative per correlated block, which in the
eigenbasis is a low-frequency band.

Here that abstract frontier is made numerical.  On a chromosome whose LD follows
the first-order Markov law of `Calibrator.ImitationRigidity` — correlation `ρ^d`
at separation `d` — the eigenvalues of the LD kernel are the values of the
Poisson-kernel symbol `ldKernelSymbol`, so both efficiencies are integrals of an
explicit function and the frontier has a closed form in the single parameter
`ρ`.  The detection normaliser is the inverse-kernel trace, whose closed form is
`ldWhiteningGain ρ = (1 + ρ²)/(1 - ρ²)`.

The headline number: at retention fraction `κ`, a pruned panel keeps only
`κ - 2ρ sin(πκ) / (π(1 + ρ²))` of the available detection weight — strictly less
than `κ`, with the shortfall maximised at 50 % retention where it equals
`2ρ / (π(1 + ρ²))`.  Pruning does not merely fail to help detection at the
margin; it loses detection weight faster than it loses markers.
-/

section ARoneFrontier

/-- **The LD spectrum is ordered by frequency.**  For nonnegative decay the
Poisson symbol is increasing in `cos angle`, so the high-variance eigendirections
are exactly the low-frequency ones.

This is the lemma that makes "LD pruning keeps the top-`k` directions by
variance" a theorem about the symbol rather than an assertion: a contiguous
low-frequency band *is* a top-`k` variance set, and therefore satisfies the
threshold hypothesis of `topVariance_minimizes_detection`. -/

/-- **Reconstruction share of a pruned (low-frequency) band** on a stationary
AR(1) chromosome, as a function of the per-site LD retention `decay` and the
fraction `kappa` of directions kept.

This is the candidate closed form of the harmonic-measure integral of the Poisson kernel:
`(2/π) · arctan( ((1+ρ)/(1-ρ)) · tan(πκ/2) )`.  The present module proves
its algebraic boundary checks but does not export an integral-identification theorem.

Valid for `0 ≤ kappa < 1`.  At `kappa = 1` the expression is not the limit —
`Real.tan (π/2) = 0` under Mathlib's junk-value convention — so the endpoint
must be read off from the integral rather than from the formula.

Empirical status: **VALIDATED**
(`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_ldband.py`). The docstring named
    the integral this is the closed form OF and said the identification was not
    packaged as a theorem; it is now measured. Adaptive quadrature over nine
    cells, `rho` in {0.2, 0.5, 0.8} crossed with `kappa` in {0.1, 0.3, 0.6}: agreement to
    1.2e-15 relative in every cell, against the normalised Poisson-kernel mass
    of the band. That is machine precision, so this is an exact identity and not
    an approximation.

    The quadrature owes nothing to the closed form -- it integrates
    `(1 - rho^2) / (1 - 2 rho cos t + rho^2)` directly -- so this is not a

## The frontier as a function of recombination rate and effective size

The section above is still parameterised by an abstract decay.  This one closes
the loop to genotype primitives: the AR(1) kernel's decay parameter *is* the
Ohta–Kimura per-generation retention `LDDecayTheory.ldRetentionPerGen r Ne`, so
every quantity on the frontier becomes an explicit function of the recombination
rate, the effective population size, and the number of markers retained.

Composition convention, inherited from
`Calibrator.ImitationRigidity.markovLDStep`: separation along the chromosome is
measured in *sites*, and one site-step carries one application of the retention
factor.  `ImitationRigidity.stationaryLDEntry_eq_ldAfterGenerations` is the
corpus theorem licensing that identification.  Reading `r` as anything other
than the per-generation recombination fraction between *adjacent* markers gives
a different kernel and different numbers.

What this buys: `pruning_loses_detection_iff_whiteningGain_exceeds_one` makes
the connection to the corpus's existing detection quantity an implication rather
than a remark — the whitening gain `ldWhiteningGain` exceeds its no-linkage
value exactly when pruning strictly loses detection weight, because the
inverse-kernel trace that the gain measures is built out of the very directions
pruning discards.  And `clumping_minimizes_detection_on_ld_kernel` states the
prohibition over a genetic pruning rule on the LD kernel itself.

Scope is unchanged and is not weakened by the instantiation: these are results
about linear, projection-type reductions of the LD kernel.  Extension to
arbitrary measurable reductions would need a joint data-processing inequality
for the detection/reconstruction pair, which does not exist.

section GeneticFrontier

/-- A valid marker-panel reduction has a nonempty original panel and cannot
retain more markers than the panel contains. `retainedMarkers` of `totalMarkers`
survive; this is the rank budget in the units a clumping tool reports. Carrying
the validity facts as data keeps division by zero and fractions above one out of
the LD-frontier interface.

/-- **The panel class is inhabited**, so the six theorems taking an
`LDPanelRetention` are statements about something rather than about an empty
class. One marker of two retained is chosen deliberately over the degenerate
fills: it satisfies `0 < retainedMarkers` and `retainedMarkers < totalMarkers`
as well, which are the side conditions those theorems carry, so the witness
exercises the interval case rather than an endpoint where the fraction is `0`
or `1`. -/

/-- **Detection share of a clumped panel**: the fraction of the whitened detection weight — the
inverse-LD-kernel trace whose per-variant limit is `ImitationRigidity.ldWhiteningGain` — that
survives clumping, as a function of the band kernel's decay and the marker counts.

`decay` is the AR(1) decay of the LD band, indexed by MARKER SEPARATION along the chromosome.
It is deliberately not computed here from a recombination rate and an effective size:
`ldRetentionPerGen` is a per-GENERATION retention, and feeding it here would make linkage
disequilibrium decay with physical distance at the rate it decays with time. The stationary law
relating separation to LD is Sved's, which this corpus carries as
`LDDecayTheory.ohtaKimuraSigmaDSq`; supplying `decay` from it is a modelling step and belongs at
the call site, where it can be named.

Empirical status: **FALSIFIED**
(`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_dgpcov.py`, group D;
`battery_dgpcov2.py`, group D2). The `kappa` of `ldBandDetectionShare` is a
fraction of DIRECTIONS -- a contiguous low-frequency band of the AR(1) symbol.
`ldPanelRetentionFraction` is a fraction of MARKERS. Feeding the second into the
first is a change of object, not a change of variable, and the two are not
close.

The instrument is exact linear algebra on the AR(1) kernel `Σᵢⱼ = ρ^|i-j|`, not
a simulation: the surviving whitened detection weight of a retained panel `S` is
`tr((Σ_SS)⁻¹) / tr(Σ⁻¹)`, computed at `n` = 512, 1024 and 2048 markers with
agreement to five digits between panel sizes, so nothing here is a finite-`n`
artefact.

(the `κ = 1/2` row at `n` = 1024, the others at `n` = 2048; the two panel sizes
agree to four digits wherever both were run)

Every marker-subset reading exceeds the body, by 38 percent at `κ = 1/2` and by
a factor of 2.5 at `κ = 1/4`; the shortfall grows as pruning gets more
aggressive, which is the regime the frontier is about. The thinned column has a
closed form -- a panel keeping every `s`-th marker of an AR(1) chromosome is
itself AR(1) at `ρ^s`, so its share is `κ(1+ρ^{2s})(1-ρ²) / ((1-ρ^{2s})(1+ρ²))`
-- and it reproduces the measured column to four digits, which is the check that
the numbers are the kernel's and not the inverter's.

POSITIVE CONTROL, and it is what makes this a falsification of the composition
rather than of `ldBandDetectionShare`: the band operation the closed form is FOR
-- the normalised mass of the reciprocal symbol on `|t| ≤ πκ`, by quadrature --
agrees with the body to five decimals in every cell above. The formula is right
about directions. It is this definition that hands it markers.

There is also no repair by substituting a different `κ`. The three marker
columns disagree with EACH OTHER at the same `κ` and `ρ` (0.262, 0.356, 0.500 at
`ρ = 0.8`, `κ = 1/2`), so the retained detection weight of a pruned panel is not
a function of `(decay, κ)` at all: it depends on WHICH markers are kept. A
definition of this signature cannot express the quantity its name claims. The
`retainedMarkers / totalMarkers` reading is charitable at that -- the reading on
which the retained weight is the retained block of `Σ⁻¹` gives exactly `κ` and a
deficit of zero. -/

/-- **Detection weight surrendered to clumping**, over and above the fraction of markers

Empirical status: **FALSIFIED**, for the reason recorded in full at
`ldBlockDetectionShare` above and on the same cells
(`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_dgpcov.py`, group D): the `kappa`
of `ldPruningDetectionDeficit` counts DIRECTIONS and `ldPanelRetentionFraction`
counts MARKERS. At `κ = 1/2` this body prices the loss at 0.25465 (`ρ = 0.5`)
and 0.31055 (`ρ = 0.8`); the measured deficit of a uniformly thinned panel is
0.15995 and 0.23805, of a random half-panel 0.08210 and 0.13969, and of a
contiguous half-panel 0.00020 and 0.00038. The frontier is therefore charging
between 1.6 and 800 times the price the kernel exacts, and the spread across those three panels
at one `(decay, κ)` is the same evidence that no function of this signature can
be the quantity. -/

`ImitationRigidity.ldWhiteningGain` is the per-variant limit of `tr K⁻¹`, the
quantity every whitened detection threshold in this corpus is stated in.  It
exceeds its no-linkage value `1` precisely when the LD kernel has spectral
spread — and that is precisely the condition under which a clumped panel loses
detection weight strictly faster than it loses markers.

This is the implication the inverse-ordering result explains: the inverse-kernel
trace is built out of the small-eigenvalue directions, clumping keeps the large
ones, so the gain being larger than one and the pruning deficit being positive
are the same fact seen from two sides.  Both sides are functions of the band decay; what that
decay is in terms of a recombination rate and an effective size is a separate modelling step,
and it is not the per-generation retention. -/

reductions of the same kernel — every linear dimension reduction with the same
budget, fractional ones included — the clumped panel has the minimum detection
efficiency.

The kernel is the AR(1) LD band at decay `decay`, indexed by marker separation. What that decay
is in terms of a recombination rate and an effective size is a modelling step named at
`ldBlockDetectionShare`; the per-generation retention is not it.

arbitrary measurable summaries of the genotypes, and no joint data-processing
inequality is available that would make it one. -/

## One correction, several deployment targets: the spread law

`ProjectionShiftBounds.sharedCorrectionOptimum` gives the recalibration each
target would choose on its own.  A score deployed to several populations gets
*one* correction.  This section prices that constraint, and the price has a
closed form: it is the curvature-weighted variance of the per-target optimal
corrections, zero exactly when they agree.

The curvature weight is not a free parameter — it is
`weight i * coefficientEnergy (B i) beta`, the deployment weight times the
transported direction's energy in that target's own second-moment matrix.  So a
target with little signal energy in the score's direction pulls the shared
correction weakly, which is the right behaviour and is forced rather than
stipulated.

Why this is worth having: multi-population incompatibility becomes a number
computable from quantities already in the corpus — compute `a_i*` per target,
take the weighted variance — instead of a program to be solved or a qualitative
warning to be repeated.
-/

section SharedCorrectionFamily

variable {ι J : Type*} [Fintype ι] [Fintype J] [DecidableEq J]

/-- **Curvature of a target's recalibration objective**: how hard target `i`
pulls on the shared correction.  Deployment weight times the energy of the
transported direction in that target's own second-moment matrix.

**DO NOT DELETE AS UNUSED.**  Nothing applies this, and that is the point of it.
`sharedCorrectionConsensus` and `sharedCorrectionSpread` below take `curvature`
and `optimum` as arbitrary functions `ι → ℝ`; this definition and
`targetCorrectionOptimum` are what say which functions the section is about.  The
section's claim that the curvature weight is FORCED rather than stipulated depends
on them: without them the weight is a free parameter, the spread law holds for any
weights whatsoever, and that claim is false.  Deleting them does not break
elaboration, because the arguments are already abstract — it hollows the claim and
leaves the file green, which is why an identifier grep is not enough to justify
removing them.

**DO NOT DELETE AS UNUSED** -- see `targetCorrectionCurvature` above.  This is
the `optimum` that `sharedCorrectionConsensus` and `sharedCorrectionSpread`
average and take the variance of; without it the "per-target optimal
corrections" their docstrings name have no referent in the corpus.

`noncomputable` because `sharedCorrectionOptimum` is: it divides by
`coefficientEnergy`, and it sits inside a `noncomputable section` in
`ProjectionShiftBounds`, so it carries no executable code. That section marker does not
travel with the name, so this definition -- outside such a section -- has to say so
itself, or the compiler IR check fails here rather than at the real-division site.

order when the deployment task changes bands.
