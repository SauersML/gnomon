# Functional descent across populations

A functional of a conditional biological law need not be a function of the retained covariate.
This module formalizes the set-level core of that question.  `DescendsOn supported section b`
allows any observability relation: positive probability, nonzero mass, assay detectability, or
study eligibility.  A `section` gives the conditional law realized by population `P` above
retained context `x`; `supported P x` says whether that version is observable.  The familiar
`FunctionalDescends mass section b` is exactly the positive-mass specialization.

The support condition is essential.  Conditional laws are only canonical where the corresponding
marginal has positive mass, so comparisons are made only on overlap.  Without a measurability
requirement, pairwise compatibility plus inhabitation of the total witness-function space is
necessary and sufficient.  On finite measurable spaces this is the exact dominated analogue; it
is not a claim that undominated standard-Borel gluing is automatic.

For polygenic-score portability, `x` can be an ancestry summary or score bin, `P` a cohort,
`section P x` the conditional genotype/phenotype law, and `b` risk, calibration, variance, or a
clinical utility functional.  The interaction and confounding witnesses below show why descent is
not monotone under adding or removing covariates.

/-- A functional descends on an arbitrary observability relation when one total context function
agrees with it at every supported population/context pair.  Nothing here requires that support
come from a real-valued mass; positive probability, nonzero finite mass, censoring eligibility,
and assay detectability are all instances of the same calculus. -/

/-- **Set-level gluing theorem.**  With no measurability requirement, pairwise compatibility
constructs a witness by choosing any observable population at each context.
