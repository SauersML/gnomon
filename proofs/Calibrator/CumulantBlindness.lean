# Cumulant blindness: no cumulant criterion decides chaos universality

Two independent obstructions to characterizing Gaussian universality of low-influence
chaos by cumulant data, formalized at their combinatorial cores.

## Statement of force, up front

Both results below are **negative** results whose force is deliberately understated.

* The hidden-tilt construction (Section 1) is, under centering, a *mean-shift*
  artifact: a centered reformulation must renormalize by the conditional variance, and
  the detecting polynomial survives only in drifted form. The theorem's letter stands
  — cumulants of every order `≤ K` are exactly Gaussian while universality fails —
  but it is the weakest of the negative results and should not be presented as more.
* The diagonal-contraction bound (Section 2) is close to tautological *relative to the
  class of criteria it quantifies over*, which we define ourselves. Its value is
  decisiveness against the exact question asked ("does vanishing of a family of
  normalized cumulant contractions characterize universality?"), not depth.

**The load-bearing negative result of the arc is not here, and it is not anywhere.** This
paragraph used to send the reader to `Calibrator.Condensation` for the condensation
mechanism and to `Calibrator.JetBarrier` for the completeness statement. Both files
disclaim exactly those results in their own headers: Condensation says "THAT PROPOSAL IS
NOT PROVED IN THIS FILE" and "NOT ONE THEOREM HERE MENTIONS CHAOS, UNIVERSALITY, OR A LIMIT
LAW", and JetBarrier says its nonlattice completeness theorem "is not formalized here" and
that nothing replaces the removed barrier.

What those files do contain is real and much smaller: Condensation has rigorous two-sided
bounds on `condensationConstant = 2 - gamma - log 2` and on `gaussianJetVariance`, from
Mathlib's Euler-Mascheroni and `log 2` brackets, plus the window algebra; JetBarrier has the
lattice-inflation arithmetic `h / (1 - exp (-h)) > 1` and its bracket. Neither carries a
mechanism, and a citation chain that ends at a disclaimer is worse than no citation, because
it reads as a discharged obligation.

## Genetics reading

A "cumulant criterion" on a genotype matrix is any diagnostic built from joint moments
of bounded order along low-influence (polygenic) directions: LD-score style second
moments, score skewness and kurtosis, moment-matching goodness-of-fit for a polygenic
score, third- and fourth-order interaction summaries. Section 1 says such a diagnostic
can be made *exactly* Gaussian to any prescribed order while the aggregate's law is
not Gaussian at all; Section 2 says that pushing to *all* orders does not help, because
the normalization forced by polygenicity (`max_i Influence_i → 0`) crushes every
diagonal cumulant by `tau ^ ((r - 2) / 2)`. Diagnostics of this family cannot certify
the score-distribution assumptions they are usually used to certify.

Section 2b makes that reading a theorem rather than a gloss. It defines the influence
of a locus as its share `β_j² h_j / ∑_i β_i² h_i` of the score variance, proves the
shares sum to one, proves that per-locus shares bounded between `d > 0` and `c` force
every influence below `c / (m · d)`, and concludes that the Section 2 bound therefore
tends to zero as the score spreads over more loci. Before that section the file
contained no locus, no effect size and no score, and the genetics reading was carried
entirely by this paragraph.

## Applicability to genotypes: unrestricted

Unlike the sign-erasure results of `Calibrator.EpistaticChaos` and the completeness
results of `Calibrator.JetBarrier`, **nothing in this file assumes the coordinate law is
sign-symmetric.** Section 1 is a pigeonhole about multi-index supports and the oddness
of the *tilt* function `s`, not of the coordinate law; Section 2 quantifies over every
i.i.d. law, explicitly including the ones that fail universality.

This matters because a standardized Hardy-Weinberg genotype is sign-symmetric at
exactly one allele frequency, `q = 1/2`
(`Calibrator.EpistaticChaos.standardizedGenotype_symmetric_iff`), so results carrying
that hypothesis say nothing about a real allele frequency spectrum. The results here
carry no such restriction: the cumulant-blindness conclusions apply to hard-called
genotypes, to imputed dosages, and to every allele frequency, without an applicability
caveat. Together with the drift theory of `Calibrator.Condensation`, this file is the
part of the arc that transfers to genotype data unconditionally.

## 1. Hidden higher-order tilts: matching all cumulants up to order `K`

The construction tilts the standard Gaussian on `R ^ d` by
`∏_j (1 + delta * ∏_{i ∈ B_j} s(x_i))` over disjoint blocks `B_j` of size `K + 1`,
where `s` is odd and bounded (`s = tanh`), so that each factor is a density and blocks
stay independent.

The reason every joint moment of total order `≤ K` is *exactly* Gaussian is a
pigeonhole, and that pigeonhole is what we prove: a multi-index of total order at most
`K` supported on a block of size `K + 1` must leave some coordinate of the block
untouched, and that coordinate contributes the factor `E[s(g)] = 0`.

`E[s(g)] = 0`, so the whole product vanishes.

The conclusion is stated in the form that refutes the problem's request: *no function

    contribute one: with no instance the statement is a conditional nobody had discharged,
    and a blindness claim with no witnessing pair is vacuous in the direction that matters.

    Here is one. Models are tilt-moment sequences, `universal` means untilted, and the data

## 2. Normalized contractions of every order: the diagonal collapse

For an i.i.d. law the joint cumulant tensor is supported on the diagonal (independence
kills mixed cumulants), so an `r`-th order normalized contraction against unit-norm,
low-influence test vectors reduces to `kappa_r * ∑_i a¹_i ⋯ aʳ_i`. Two of the vectors
are absorbed by Cauchy-Schwarz; the remaining `r - 2` are each bounded by
`sqrt tau` in the sup norm, where `tau` is the influence budget. So the contraction is
`O(tau ^ ((r - 2) / 2))` and vanishes for every fixed `r ≥ 3`.

The Gaussian's cumulants of order `≥ 3` vanish identically. Hence *every* fixed-order
normalized contraction agrees asymptotically between the i.i.d. law and the Gaussian,
whatever the i.i.d. law is — and by `Calibrator.Condensation` the two can nonetheless
differ in universality.

diagonal contraction bound needs one further step -- that an i.i.d. coordinate law makes the
cumulant tensor supported on the diagonal, so that an `r`-th order contraction collapses to
this single sum -- and THAT STEP IS NOT PROVED ANYWHERE IN THIS CORPUS. It is the reason the
name says `weighted_inner` rather than `contraction`.

What the reading buys, if the missing step is supplied elsewhere: with `M = tau ^ ((r-2)/2)`
and `tau -> 0` under low influence, every fixed-order normalized contraction vanishes, for
every i.i.d. coordinate law including those failing universality. -/

## 2b. The low-influence parameter, in score units

Section 2 bounds a normalized contraction by `|κ| · τ^(k/2)` where `τ` bounds the
remaining factors, and observes that `τ → 0` "under the problem's low-influence
hypothesis". That hypothesis was stated about an abstract index set. Nothing above
named a locus, an effect size or an allele frequency, so the genetics reading in the
header was carried entirely by prose.

This section supplies the missing object. For an additive score `∑_j β_j g_j` at
linkage equilibrium, locus `j` contributes `β_j² · h_j` to the score variance, where
`h_j` is the genotype variance at that locus — `2 p_j (1 - p_j)` for a Hardy--Weinberg
locus, but nothing here needs that form. The **influence** of locus `j` is its share of
the total, and polygenicity is the statement that no share is large.

What is proved: the shares are nonnegative and sum to one, and if every share lies
between `d > 0` and `c` then no influence exceeds `c / (m · d)`. Composing that with
Section 2 gives the bound in score units — as a score is spread over more loci, the
fixed-order normalized contraction bound tends to zero, whatever the per-locus law is.

The direction of the conclusion is worth stating plainly, because it is the reverse of
how such diagnostics are normally used. A vanishing bound is not evidence that the score
is Gaussian. It says the diagnostic cannot tell, because it is driven to zero by
polygenicity alone and would report the same value for a law that is not Gaussian at all.

A score whose loci contribute equally has influence exactly `1 / m` at every locus.
Setting `c = d` in `locusInfluence_le_of_shares_bounded` gives the ceiling `1 / m`, and
this says that ceiling is reached, so the bound is sharp rather than a bound no
configuration approaches.

This matters for reading the vanishing result below. If the ceiling were unattainable,
"influence at most `c / (m · d)`" could hold for a reason having nothing to do with
polygenicity, and the limit would be an artifact of a loose estimate. It is not: the
balanced score sits exactly on it. -/

/-- **A monomorphic locus has no influence.**  At allele frequency `0` or `1` the

This is the configuration the lower bound `d > 0` of
`locusInfluence_le_of_shares_bounded` excludes, and it is excluded for a reason rather
than for convenience: a panel padded with monomorphic sites raises `m` without lowering
any real locus's influence, so a bound stated in terms of `m` alone would be gameable by
adding columns that carry no signal. -/

/-- **Cumulant blindness in score units.**  As a score is spread over more loci with
per-locus variance shares between `d > 0` and `c`, the fixed-order normalized
contraction bound of Section 2 tends to zero.

The conclusion runs the opposite way from how such a diagnostic is normally read. A
vanishing contraction is not evidence that the score's law is Gaussian: the bound is
driven to zero by polygenicity alone, and `abs_smul_weighted_inner_le` holds for every
coordinate law, including the ones that fail universality. So the diagnostic reports the

/-! ### Wiring to the corpus's additive-variance model

The section above is stated for an arbitrary per-locus variance `h`.  This ties it to
`Calibrator.additiveVariance`, the corpus's own linkage-equilibrium additive variance
`∑ᵢ 2 pᵢ (1 - pᵢ) αᵢ²`, so the influence bound is a statement about allele frequencies
and effect sizes rather than about an abstract weight vector.

`additiveVariance` carries its own empirical status -- VALIDATED at linkage
equilibrium, and FALSIFIED read unconditionally, because it drops the LD cross term.
That status transfers to everything below: these are statements about a score at
linkage equilibrium, and the influence shares are not the true shares when `D ≠ 0`. -/

/-- The abstract score variance at Hardy--Weinberg genotype variances IS the corpus's
`additiveVariance`. -/

/-- **The low-influence hypothesis, at a Hardy--Weinberg panel.**

If every locus contributes between `d > 0` and `c` to the additive variance, no locus
influence exceeds `c / (m · d)`.  Composed with `pgs_contraction_bound_tendsto_zero`
this is Section 2's conclusion stated entirely in genetic quantities: allele
frequencies, effect sizes, and the number of loci.

Interior frequencies are what make `d > 0` available -- a monomorphic locus
contributes exactly zero and would break the lower bound, which is the same
polymorphism condition the rest of the corpus carries. -/

## 3. What survives

Put together with `Calibrator.Condensation`:

* fixed-order cumulant data can be made exactly Gaussian while universality fails
  (Section 1), so no fixed-order criterion decides the property;
* all-orders normalized contraction data is asymptotically *identical* for every
  i.i.d. law and the Gaussian (Section 2), so no contraction criterion of any order
  decides it either;
* the obstruction is therefore not in the cumulant category at all. It is in the
  Mellin data `theta ↦ E |x| ^ (2 * theta)` at the interior point `theta = 1`, which
  no jet at the origin determines.

`Calibrator.JetBarrier` computes exactly what *is* observable there.
