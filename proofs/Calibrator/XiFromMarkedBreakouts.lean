# A sweep trajectory does not determine the genealogy it leaves

This is the hard-sweep versus soft-sweep distinction, stated as an identifiability theorem.

A beneficial allele rising to frequency `x` can do so from a single origin, or from several
independent origins each carrying part of the final frequency.  The allele-frequency
trajectory is identical in both cases: same times, same increments, same final frequency.  The
genealogies are not, and the difference is not a matter of degree.

`MarkedBreakoutUniversality` proves that the unconditioned genealogy does not determine the
speed-conditioned one, so the displacement mark is indispensable.  This file first constructs
the corresponding measure on countable family-mass partitions, including its exponential speed
tilt and Kingman component.  It then proves the stronger nonidentifiability statement, which cuts
the other way: even the *complete* trajectory — every sweep time, every increment — does not
determine the genealogy.

The gap is that a sweep need not have one origin.  Recording only the total
fraction `x` collapses a mass partition `η = (η₁, η₂, …)` to its first coordinate, and the
genealogy depends on the partition through

  `σ(η) = ∑ᵢ ηᵢ²`,

which is the probability that a specified pair of blocks lands in the same family.  The
Λ-coalescent of `MarkedBreakoutUniversality` is the one-family case `σ((x,0,…)) = x²`; a general
mass partition gives a Ξ-coalescent, and every finite Ξ measure is realisable by taking
`ν = Ξ/σ`.  So the marked-mass-partition picture covers the whole phase diagram, including the
simultaneous-multiple-merger regimes that the one-family theorem cannot reach.

The obstruction is exhibited concretely.  Two mechanisms,

  `η_single = (x, 0, …)`   and   `η_split = (x/2, x/2, 0, …)`,

are a hard sweep and a two-origin soft sweep reaching the same total frequency.  They have the
same trajectory in every detail.  They differ in two ways no frequency statistic sees:

* `paintboxWeight_single_ne_split`: `σ` is `x²` against `x²/2`, so the soft sweep coalesces
  lineages at half the rate -- it leaves twice the diversity for the same frequency change;
* `disjointPairMerge_single_zero` and `disjointPairMerge_split`: four sampled lineages can fall
  into two distinct origin classes, two in each, with probability `6(x/2)⁴` under the soft sweep
  and probability zero under the hard one.  That is not a rate difference.  It is an event of a
  shape a single-origin sweep cannot produce at all, which is why it, and not any diversity
  level, is the separating observable.

`front_does_not_determine_genealogy` is those two facts together, and it fixes what a study can
and cannot conclude.  Sweep multiplicity is not recoverable from allele-frequency data, at any
sample size or sequencing depth, because the trajectories coincide exactly.  It is recoverable
from a four-lineage haplotype statistic, and the biology core records the resulting ladder:
two lineages see nothing, three see the merger rate, four see the number of origins.

The same theorem is the reason front convergence cannot prove a branching-selection genealogy
result: however complete, it does not carry the ancestry-sensitive information.

The final sections sharpen the reduction.  The derivative-martingale tail supplies the
heavy-tailed subtree mark; the model-specific input is instead the normalized selected flux.
`weightedParetoExceedanceMass_eq_flux` turns that flux into the first-order breakout law, while
`distinctPairParetoExceedanceMass_le_flux_sq` makes two breakouts quadratic in the block scale.
`oneSuccessfulAncestor_produces_onePaintboxAtom` then records the pathwise fact that later
branching below one pioneer cannot create a second origin.  What remains independent is the
common-profile estimate: `pioneerCountFraction_eq_of_commonProfile` derives `w/(1+w)` only after
both colours share one amplitude-per-particle conversion.

`pioneerDisplacement_eq_logDisplacement` and `pioneerIntensity_jacobian` are the change of
variables `w ↦ (w/(1+w), γ⁻¹log(1+w))` under which the `w⁻²dw` pioneer intensity becomes exactly
`x⁻²dx` and the response becomes the logarithmic displacement law.  And
`logDisplacement_injOn` is the formulation correction for lattice models: the response map is
injective, so distinct fractions demand distinct displacements, which a lattice-valued
displacement cannot supply across a continuum of fractions.

The exact rank-one response algebra is formalized below.  Not asserted are the probabilistic
concentration needed to apply it through the endogenous selection boundary, the uniform
rare-block marked law, or convergence of the marked point process.  Those need the two-colour tip
estimate that is the open step.
