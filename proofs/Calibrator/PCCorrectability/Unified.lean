# End-to-end correctability theorems

This module connects the spectral, second-moment, and application-risk layers.  Its statements expose exactly where the rank-one
overlap model is used and where a distribution-free discrepancy bound can be
substituted instead.

residual fraction to an ancestry axis and then coupling it to marker-axis
variance. -/

so residual susceptibility equals uncorrected susceptibility exactly. -/

not eliminate, susceptibility.  This is the precise risk-level consequence of
the Johnstone--Paul overlap curve. -/
