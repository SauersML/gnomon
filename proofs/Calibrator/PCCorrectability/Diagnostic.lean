### Test-specific ancestry axis

Blanc and Berg identify, for a pre-specified PGS association test, one GWAS-panel
axis `F̃_Gr` that carries every confounding contribution relevant to that test.
The next equivalence is the finite-dimensional necessity-and-sufficiency result:
zeroing that residual axis protects the test against every confounder, and no
nonzero residual axis can provide such a uniform guarantee.
-/

/-- Bias in a PGS association statistic along a residual cross-panel ancestry
axis.  `scale` collects the positive locus- and panel-count factors.

    Regime: the residual axis CENTRED, which is what PC correction leaves
    behind. That is load-bearing and is the whole content of the comparison
    below.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED** (`simcov/battery_bulk41.py`, `group_b`).
    200000 individuals; the expected phenotype carries a gradient along the
    residual axis plus an offset, and the observable is the realised
    association of the DRAWN phenotype with that axis. Worst cell 1.78 sems at
    1.31% relative, over designs where the offset runs 0 to 1 and the axis
    spread 0.5 to 2.

    Power, and the practical warning: the same inner product with the axis left
    UNCENTRED misses by up to 894 sems (1333% relative). The two agree exactly
    when the offset is zero and diverge without bound as it grows -- at
    `shift = 1.0` the uncentred form reads 1.075 where the truth is 0.075, a
    fourteenfold overstatement. This is the error that makes a PC-corrected
    test look catastrophically biased when it is nearly clean, and it is
    invisible in any design that only ever centres its phenotype. The competing
    form is recorded as a LEAD rather than a falsification because this run's
    control was DEGENERATE: the axis is centred by construction, so "the axis
    has mean zero" compares a number against itself and cannot fail. The
    harness detected that and voided it; the MATCH above does not rest on it. -/

### Residual susceptibility and application-level risk

Blanc, Mawass, and Berg refine the target-axis geometry into an empirical
diagnostic.  If `σf²` is variance along the GWAS-panel target axis and `σr²`
is marker variance along the corresponding prediction-panel contrast, then
`H = σf² σr²`.  After correction, the same definition with residual ancestry
variance gives `H'`.  This section makes explicit how an upstream overlap
lower bound becomes a lower bound on `H'`, and how `H'` combines with
ascertainment to determine the critical confounding magnitude.
-/

/-- Genetic variance in the GWAS panel explained by a specified external
ancestry gradient.  This is `H` before correction and `H'` when
`ancestryVariance` is the residual variance after correction.

    Regime: the marker's loading on the axis and the ancestry coordinate
    independent and centred. Independence is what makes the variance of their
    product the product of their variances; correlated loadings would add a
    covariance term this body has no room for.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED** (`simcov/battery_bulk41.py`, `group_a`).
    400000 individuals with an ancestry coordinate and a marker loading drawn
    independently; the observable is the realised variance of their product,
    which is the confounding component an ancestry gradient induces. Worst cell
    1.02 sems at 0.69% relative.

    Power: the two variances are swept in OPPOSITE directions -- (1, 1),
    (4, 0.25), (0.5, 2), (2, 3) -- so a body that is merely monotone in each
    argument cannot survive. The SUM is FALSIFIED at 483 sems (324% relative)
    and the GEOMETRIC MEAN at 88 sems (59%), which is what fixes the
    combination as multiplicative rather than either of the obvious
    alternatives.

    The error bar is inflated threefold over the normal formula for a variance,
    because the product of two centred normals is heavy-tailed and the normal
    sem understates its own scatter -- the same correction that turned a
    spurious falsification of `spikeAndSlabVariance` into the noise it was. -/
