## The second non-identifiability, and where its boundary sits

The theorem above says one *summary* of the design -- aggregate differentiation -- does
not determine correctability. `Calibrator.HiddenConeAmbiguity` says something stronger and
about a different object: even the **complete noiseless second-moment content** of the
data does not determine the hidden mixing, and it locates exactly when it does.

Read a decay profile `t : ℕ → ℝ` as the sequence of ancestry mixing scales -- the singular
values of the latent-to-observed map, in the order a PC decomposition returns them.
`BoundedLogDistortion t t'` is the relation "these two hidden explanations differ by a
bounded change of hidden coordinates", which is exactly the ambiguity a PC basis cannot
resolve. The dichotomy below is sharp and has nothing in between:

* **Bounded condition number is rigidity.** If both profiles are trapped between positive
  constants -- finitely many ancestry components, mixing bounded away from zero -- they are
  always equivalent, so nothing is lost by fixing a basis. The class is inhabited by
  constant profiles (`boundedBelowAbove_const`), so this side is not vacuous.
* **Losing the lower bound is total.** Once the mixing decays without a positive floor,
  profiles with identical second-moment observables become inequivalent, and the fiber over
  one observable carries a faithful copy of the universal sigma-compact relation.

For PC correction this is the statement that the number of PCs retained is not the binding
constraint. What binds is whether the retained mixing scales stay above a positive floor.
Below the floor, no amount of second-moment data -- not more markers, not more samples --
distinguishes the hidden structures, because they have the same second moments exactly.
-/

/-- **The identifiability dichotomy for ancestry mixing profiles.**

Both halves at once, at a fixed pair of bounds. The first conjunct is rigidity: any two
mixing profiles confined to `[a, b]` with `a > 0` are related by a bounded change of hidden
coordinates. The second exhibits, over any gap sequence `B`, two coded profiles that are
*not* so related -- an explicit inequivalent pair, taking the coding sequences to be `0`
and `n`, whose `ℓ∞` separation is unbounded by the Archimedean property.

The two conjuncts are stated together because either alone reads as the whole answer and
neither is: the content is that the boundary between them is exactly the positive lower
bound on the mixing, with no intermediate regime.

    Empirical status: NOT AN EMPIRICAL CLAIM -- a statement about which hidden models
    share second-order observables, carrying no assertion about any dataset. -/
