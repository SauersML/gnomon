# Frequency-resolved correctability diagnostic

Recent structure need not have the same differentiation in common, rare, and
IBD-derived marker classes. The quantities below keep effective independent
marker counts and differentiation separate by class.

### The combined information index

`map/correctability.rs` reports one whole-design summary,
`combined_information_index = 4 · effectiveSubgroupSize · √(ΣM_cF_c² / n)`, that had no
definition anywhere in this corpus: a shipped number with no stated meaning.  Differential
testing over a 1010-design sweep confirmed the body byte-for-byte and, more usefully, found
what it *is*: for a single marker class it is exactly the spike-to-threshold ratio, so the
familiar `> 1` reading is the BBP detectability test in disguise.

/-- **The index is the spike measured in threshold units.**  Multiplying it back by the BBP
threshold returns the rank-one spike exactly, so `combinedInformationIndex > 1` is
`demographicSpike > bbpProxyThreshold` — the same detectability test the per-class report
runs — whenever the design has one marker class. -/

### Admissibility gap against the shipped validator

`map/correctability.rs::validate` rejects designs this structure accepts.  It requires
`subgroup_size < sample_size` and `differentiation ≤ 1` (the Hudson `F_ST` scale); the fields
above require only positivity and nonnegativity.  Every theorem stated over
`FrequencyResolvedCohort` therefore also quantifies over designs the shipped calculator
refuses to score, and the next result shows those designs are not harmless — the effective
subgroup size, which the whole spike scale is built on, goes nonpositive there.
-/

def FrequencyResolvedCohort.CalculatorAdmissible {classes : ℕ}
    (cohort : FrequencyResolvedCohort classes) : Prop :=
  cohort.subgroupSize < cohort.sampleSize ∧ ∀ i, cohort.differentiation i ≤ 1

/-- **A cohort the shipped validator accepts.**  `FrequencyResolvedCohort.witness` above is
*not* admissible — it has `subgroupSize = sampleSize = 1`, which `validate` rejects — so
without this second witness `CalculatorAdmissible` would be a property only ever assumed.
This one splits a two-person panel and carries the maximal legal differentiation. -/

  effectiveMarkers_pos := fun _ ↦ by norm_num

/-- **The gap is not vacuous.**  A cohort satisfying every field of the structure but violating
the shipped validator's `subgroup_size < sample_size` has nonpositive effective subgroup size,
hence a nonpositive spike for every nonnegative differentiation: the margin is then negative for
purely arithmetic reasons and reports "uncorrectable" for a design the calculator would have
refused to accept at all. -/
