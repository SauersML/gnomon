# Johnstone--Paul overlap curve

Writing `c = n/M` and `s = λ - 1` for the population spike above the noise
eigenvalue, the asymptotic squared overlap is
`(1 - c/s²) / (1 + c/s)` above `s = √c`, and zero below it.

### The fitted-PC-count gate

Detectability is not the only gate the shipped calculator applies.  A marker class whose
ancestry axis is the `r`-th population PC is only residualized away if the analyst actually
fitted at least `r` PCs.  Detecting an axis at rank 30 and then fitting 10 PCs removes none
of it.

The definitions above model only the spectral gate, and differential testing against
`map/correctability.rs` found the gap: on the shipped calculator's own unit-test fixture
(`n = 1000`, `M = 4000`, `F = 0.01`, `m = 500`, `theoretical_pc_rank = 3`, `fitted_pcs = 2`)
the calculator reports `residual_axis_fraction = 1` — nothing removed — while
`samplePCResidualAxisFraction` gives `0.0268`.  Over a 1010-design sweep the two disagree on
160 of 1971 marker-class instances, always in the optimistic direction.  The definitions
below close the gap.

/-- Fraction of the target ancestry axis actually removed by a requested PC set, as computed
by the shipped calculator.  `pcRank` is the one-based population-PC index carrying the axis,
`fittedPCs` the number of PCs the analyst requested. -/

/-- **The shipped conjunction is the same function.**  `map/correctability.rs` gates removal
on `detectable_by_sample_pca && theoretical_pc_rank <= fitted_pcs`, whereas
`removedAxisFraction` gates on the rank alone.  The two agree because `samplePCOverlapSq` is
already zero below the edge, so the detectability conjunct is redundant.  Stating this is what
makes the single-gate definition a faithful model rather than a simplification. -/

/-- **An axis outside the fitted PC budget is untouched, however detectable it is.**  This is
the content the spectral model alone does not carry: no amount of separation rescues an axis
the analyst did not fit a PC for.  It is also the exact sense in which
`samplePCResidualAxisFraction` is optimistic about the shipped calculator. -/
