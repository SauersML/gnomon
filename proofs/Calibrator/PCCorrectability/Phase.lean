/-- **The danger index is the confounding energy measured in units of the BBP
threshold.** The two aspect-ratio factors are exact reciprocals --
`markerDangerIndex` carries `√(M/n)` and `bbpProxyThreshold` carries `√(n/M)` --
so their product is the confounding energy alone, with the design dropping out
entirely.

This is why the two quantities belong in one phase diagram rather than two.
`more_markers_increase_uncorrectable_bias_danger` says the danger grows with the
panel and `bbpProxyThreshold_aspect_invariant` says detectability depends only
on `n/M`; stated separately those are two monotonicities in the same variable
with no stated relation, and a reader has no way to tell whether the danger
index is a second, independent scaling or the same one read from the other side.
It is the same one. Until this identity existed the module imported
`Calibrator.PCCorrectability.Threshold` and used nothing from it, so the
dependency was declared and never honoured. -/

/-- **The detectable side of the phase diagram is exactly `danger index < 1`.**
A design corrects the confounder when the spike clears the BBP proxy threshold;
the identity above turns that comparison into a single dimensionless number, so
the phase boundary is at one rather than at a design-dependent value.

Note which direction is which: a LARGER danger index is the undetectable side.
The index rises with the panel, so adding effectively independent markers at
fixed sample size moves a design across the boundary in the wrong direction --
the content of `more_markers_increase_uncorrectable_bias_danger`, now located on
the phase diagram instead of standing alone. -/
