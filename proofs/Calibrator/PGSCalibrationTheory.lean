# PGS Calibration Theory

This file formalizes the theory of PGS calibration — the relationship
between predicted risk and observed outcomes. Calibration is distinct
from discrimination (AUC/R²) and can vary independently across
populations.

Key results:
1. Calibration definitions (calibration-in-the-large, slope, Hosmer-Lemeshow)
2. Calibration vs discrimination independence
3. Population-specific calibration drift
4. Recalibration methods and their limits
5. Decision-theoretic implications of miscalibration

Provenance: derived here, not imported. Wang et al. (2026), Nature Communications 17:942,
substantiates nothing below. It is an empirical study of the polygenic-score portability
gap and does not treat the calibration slope, calibration-in-the-large or the
Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Sources for individual results, where they exist, are cited at
those results.

## Calibration Definitions

A PGS is well-calibrated if E[Y|PGS = s] = s for binary outcomes,
or if E[Y|PGS = s] = f(s) where f is the identity for the
intended scale.

## Calibration vs Discrimination

Calibration and discrimination are independent properties.
A model can have good discrimination but poor calibration
and vice versa.
-/

section CalibrationVsDiscrimination

/-- **Additive score shifts preserve AUC and shift CITL by the same offset.**

    AUC depends only on pairwise ranking of scores. Adding a constant offset leaves every
    pairwise comparison unchanged, so population AUC is invariant. Calibration-in-the-large
    shifts by exactly that offset with opposite sign.

    This is not a claim that AUC is independent of calibration, which would be a two-sided
    claim about a family of models. What is exhibited is one family — constant offsets —
    along which AUC is constant and CITL is not. That refutes "discrimination determines
    calibration", which is the use the file makes of it, and does not establish the
    converse, that calibration fails to constrain discrimination.

    Note also that `mean_obs` and `mean_pred` are free reals unconnected to `pop` or
    `score`: the CITL half of the conjunction is an algebraic identity about two arbitrary
    numbers, not a computation of the AUC-invariant score's calibration. -/

/-- **At a fixed mean prediction, the CITL difference is exactly the prevalence
    difference.**

    The name is kept because `LongitudinalPortability` depends on it, but read it as the
    identity it is: `calibrationInTheLarge` is `observed − predicted`, so holding the
    prediction fixed and moving the observed mean from `π₁` to `π₂` moves CITL by
    `π₂ − π₁`. That is `ring`, and in particular it says nothing when `π₁ = π₂`. The
    consequence the name suggests — that a prevalence *change* forces a calibration change —
    is the special case `π₁ ≠ π₂` of this identity, and holds only under the fixed-mean
    prediction assumption built into the statement. -/

/-- Explicit cross-population calibration-shift budget.

This state separates the distinct reasons why identity-scale calibration can
change after transport:

- prevalence / mean outcome shift,
- environmental mean-outcome shift,
- genetic mean-outcome shift not captured by prevalence alone,
- score-mean transport shift from changed target genetic architecture, and
- any deployment intercept offset applied to the transported score.

This does not treat target calibration drift as a function of prevalence
alone. -/

/-- **Exact cross-ancestry metric profile from the mechanistic SNP-level
transport model plus an explicit calibration-shift budget.**

This is the headline exact theorem for the calibration block:

- AUC is the mechanistic source-vs-target AUC from the explicit
  source-weights-on-target-covariance score equation;
- CITL is the explicit observed-minus-predicted target shift budget;
- absolute CITL worsens whenever that shift budget is nonzero; and
- Brier is the mechanistic source-vs-target calibrated Brier comparison on the
  target-population observed prevalence scale.

No neutral-allele-frequency benchmark metrics appear in the statement. This is
the generic shift-budget corollary used by the fully mechanistic calibration
law below.

**What is assumed rather than derived**, since the word "exact" in the name is about the
formulae and not about the direction of travel. Three of the four conclusions are
transport of a hypothesis, not a discovery:

- `targetMetrics.auc < sourceMetrics.auc` and `sourceMetrics.brier < targetMetrics.brier`
  both come from `h_r2_drop`, which *assumes* the target R² is lower. Nothing here shows
  that cross-ancestry transport lowers R². What is proved is that a drop in R² propagates
  to AUC and to calibrated Brier through the monotone charts — a real and reusable step,
  but a conditional one.
- `|sourceProfile.citl| < |targetProfile.citl|` is immediate from `h_src_cal`, which
  assumes the source is perfectly calibrated in the large, together with
  `h_shift_nonzero`. Against a source CITL pinned to `0`, any nonzero shift is worse.

This theorem carries **no** `hPhiStrict : StrictMono Phi` hypothesis, and needs none.
`Probability.strictMono_Phi` proves it: `Phi` is `ProbabilityTheory.cdf (gaussianReal 0 1)`,
and its strict monotonicity follows from the Gaussian density being positive.  Every use
below resolves against that theorem. -/

/-- **Exact cross-ancestry metric portability law from the mechanistic
SNP-level transport model and mechanistic calibration state.**

This is the headline law surface for deployed metrics:

- AUC is the mechanistic source-vs-target AUC from the explicit
  source-weights-on-target-covariance score equation;
- CITL is the exact biological mean-shift budget
  `observed drift - source-weighted score-mean drift - deployment intercept drift`;
- calibration slope is the literal transported `Cov/Var` ratio on the same
  score equation; and
- Brier is the mechanistic source-vs-target calibrated Brier comparison on the
  target-population observed prevalence scale.

The same reading applies as for `source_to_target_exact_metric_profile_from_shift_budget`,
which this theorem is a mechanistic instance of: the AUC drop and the Brier worsening are
carried by the hypothesis `h_r2_drop`, and the calibration worsening by `h_src_cal`
together with `h_shift_nonzero`. "Exact" qualifies the formulae for CITL and slope, which
are computed from the SNP-level state, not the direction of the metric changes, which are
assumed. -/

/-! The two projection theorems in this section take the same model, the same calibration
shift model, and the same three assumptions about them -- an `R²` in the unit interval at
each population, a drop between them, and a perfectly calibrated source.  Each restated
that block, eight lines of it, and the restatements are what the duplication guard was
seeing.  The block is a `variable` line here, and `include` makes it a premise of each
theorem exactly as writing it out did; what differs between the two theorems stays written
where it differs. -/

This is the AUC+CITL projection of the full exact metric theorem above. The
discrimination term is the mechanistic AUC from the explicit SNP-level
transport model, and the calibration term is the full observed-minus-predicted
target shift budget.

The name `cross_ancestry_auc_drops_and_citl_worsens_from_explicit_shift_budget` is absent
on purpose. It asserts that cross-ancestry AUC drops, and this theorem does not show that.
`h_r2_drop` assumes the R² drop and the monotone chart carries it to AUC. `h_src_cal` and
`h_shift_nonzero` assume a perfectly calibrated source and a nonzero budget, against which
any shift is worse. The qualifier `from_explicit_shift_budget` covers the calibration half
alone, so the name must state the R² input too. -/

/-! ### Post-hoc recalibration cannot reorder, and refitting can

`logistic_recalibration_corrects_citl_and_slope` shows an affine map in the logit fixes
calibration-in-the-large and the calibration slope, and `logistic_recalibration_preserves_auc`
shows it leaves discrimination untouched. The second is usually read as reassurance. It is also a
limitation, and this section makes the limitation exact.

A post-hoc recalibration is a monotone map applied to a fitted score, and monotone maps preserve
order. So if the true conditional risk ranks two individuals in the opposite order to the fitted
score, NO recalibration recovers it -- not Platt, not isotonic, not any procedure whose only
input is the score. Refitting the index does recover it, and the witness below exhibits both
halves on two individuals.

This is what separates recalibration from joint estimation. Fitting a link and an index together
can move the ranking; fitting the index under a fixed link and repairing the output afterwards
cannot. The gap is not a matter of sample size, and no amount of calibration data closes it.

Empirical status: DERIVED. The witness is exhibited, not measured; the claim is about what
post-hoc maps can express.

so any monotone map puts their recalibrated risks in that order too, while the target does not. -/
