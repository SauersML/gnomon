# Ancestry-Specific Genetic Architecture

This file formalizes how genetic architecture parameters
(effect sizes, allele frequencies, LD patterns) differ across
ancestries and how these differences create portability barriers.

Key results:
1. Allele frequency divergence via drift
2. Effect size heterogeneity from GxE
3. Ancestry-specific LD tagging
4. Allelic heterogeneity (different causal variants per locus)
5. Architecture convergence under shared environments

Provenance: derived here, not imported. Wang et al. (2026), Nature Communications 17:942,
substantiates nothing below. It is an empirical study of the polygenic-score portability
gap and does not treat drift models of allele-frequency divergence, allelic heterogeneity
or LD tagging. Sources for individual results, where they exist, are cited at those
results.

## Allele Frequency Divergence

Allele frequency differences between populations are the

### Derivation of expectedFreqDiffSq = 2·F·p₀(1-p₀)

**Which `F` this section's `fst` argument is, stated -- it is NOT the pairwise
`F_ST` the rest of the corpus is written for.**

Every `fst` argument in this section is the PER-BRANCH drift coefficient: the
single-population Wright `F` measured against the ANCESTOR, i.e. the fraction of
ancestral heterozygosity a lineage has lost since the split. Three distinct
quantities share the letter across this development and they are not
interchangeable:

* **Per-branch drift `F`** (this section). `1 - (1 - 1/(2·Nₑ))^t`, which is
  `PopulationGeneticsFoundations.heterozygosityLossFromDrift`, approaching
  `1 - e^(-τ)` in coalescent time.
* **Pairwise Hudson `F_ST`** (`PortabilityDrift.fstFromTau`), `τ/(1 + τ)`.
  These two are NOT equal, and the corpus proves it: `fstFromTau_lt_coalescenceCdf`
  says `τ/(1+τ) < 1 - e^(-τ)` at every positive `τ`. At `τ = 1` they are `0.500`
  against `0.632`, a 26% gap -- so the substitution is a real error and not a
  rounding one. They agree only to first order in small divergence.
* **Nei's `G_ST`** (`Conventions.neiGst`), which is `(p₁-p₂)²/(4·p̄·(1-p̄))` and
  is HALF the per-branch `F` this section wants, since this section's identity
  reads `E[(p₁-p₂)²] = 2·F·p₀(1-p₀)` while Nei's reads
  `E[(p₁-p₂)²] = 4·G_ST·p̄·(1-p̄)`. Feeding `neiGst` to `expectedFreqDiffSq`
  halves the answer.

The sentence this note replaces -- "this **is** the definition of Fst" -- was
the defect: it named a WITHIN-population heterozygosity loss as a
BETWEEN-population variance ratio, which is exactly the conflation
`Calibrator.DriftRegime` exists to prohibit and which `Conventions`'
`fstFromDrift_uses_coalescentTimeScale` docstring already names as the corpus's
recurring `F_ST` bug. Nothing outside this file consumes these three
definitions, so no downstream value is wrong today; the trap was live for the
next consumer.

Under the Wright-Fisher model, genetic drift causes allele frequencies
to fluctuate randomly across generations. For a single population
diverging from an ancestor with allele frequency p₀:

  Var(p_t - p₀) = p₀(1-p₀) × F(t)

with `F(t)` the per-branch drift coefficient just defined.

**Single-population drift variance:**
  driftVariance(p₀, F) = p₀·(1-p₀)·F

**Two-population divergence:**
Consider two populations (pop₁, pop₂) that diverged independently
from the same ancestral population with frequency p₀. Their allele
frequency deviations (p₁ - p₀) and (p₂ - p₀) are independent
because drift is driven by independent sampling in each lineage.

  E[(p₁ - p₂)²] = Var(p₁ - p₂)          (since E[p₁ - p₂] = 0)
                 = Var(p₁) + Var(p₂)      (independence of drift)
                 = p₀(1-p₀)·F + p₀(1-p₀)·F
                 = 2·p₀(1-p₀)·F

The factor of 2 arises because **both** lineages drift independently,
so the variance of their difference is the sum of their individual
drift variances.
-/

/-- **Drift variance for a single population.**
    `Var(p_t - p₀) = p₀(1-p₀) × F`, with `F` the PER-BRANCH drift coefficient --
    the fraction of ancestral heterozygosity this one lineage has lost since the
    split, Wright's `F` against the ancestor.

    Convention: `fst` is that per-branch `F`, not the pairwise Hudson `F_ST` of
    `PortabilityDrift.fstFromTau` and not Nei's `G_ST`. The section note above
    gives the three conversions and the size of each mistake; the short version
    is that Hudson agrees only to first order (`0.500` against `0.632` at
    `τ = 1`) and Nei's `G_ST` is exactly half of what this argument wants.

    Empirical status: **the simulation MATCH is an algebraic identity and carries no
    information.** `battery_bulk21` scored this MATCH against a Wright-Fisher simulation;
    the verdict is vacuous. The simulator estimates `F_ST` on the same run as
    `Var(p) / (p₀(1-p₀))`, and substituting that defining relation into this body gives
    `p₀(1-p₀) · Var(p) / (p₀(1-p₀)) = Var(p)` — the estimator itself, residual exactly `0`
    under computer algebra, using no Wright-Fisher property beyond the martingale
    `E[p_t] = p₀`. On the same cells a competing body that is genuinely a different
    function of the same inputs is separable (a planted `p₀(1-p₀)·fst²` leaves the nonzero
    residual `Var(p)·(-Var(p) - p₀² + p₀)/(p₀(p₀-1))`), so the design had power it never
    spent: it was pointed at a definition. The docstring's own first sentence says as much.
    UNTESTED as a claim about the world; what is actually open is the convention question
    the paragraph above states, and an identity cannot settle it. -/

    For two populations diverging independently from the same
    ancestor, Var(p₁ - p₂) = Var(p₁) + Var(p₂) = 2·driftVariance.
    The factor of 2 comes from independence of drift.

    Empirical status: **the simulation MATCH is an algebraic identity and carries no
    information**, for the reason given at `driftVariance`, of which this is twice the body.
    Substituting the simulator's own `F_ST := Var(p)/(p₀(1-p₀))` collapses this onto
    `2·Var(p)`, which is what the simulator computes for `Var(p₁ - p₂)` once the two
    lineages are drawn independently — residual exactly `0`. The factor of `2` the docstring
    argues for is therefore assumed by the estimator, not tested by it. UNTESTED as a claim

/-- **Expected allele frequency difference from drift.**
    `E[(p₁ - p₂)²] = 2 × F × p₀(1-p₀)`, `p₀` the ancestral frequency and `F` the
    per-branch drift coefficient of `driftVariance`.

    Convention: the `2` is the count of independently drifting branches, and it
    is the constant that goes wrong when the argument is read as a pairwise
    differentiation instead. Against Nei's `G_ST` the same expectation is
    `4·G_ST·p̄·(1-p̄)`, so `fst := neiGst p₁ p₂` halves this body. See the
    section note.

    Empirical status: **the simulation MATCH is an algebraic identity and carries no
    information.** `battery_bulk21` scored this MATCH; this body is `twoPopDriftVariance`
    with its arguments in the other order, so it collapses onto the simulator's `2·Var(p)`
    for the same reason and with the same exactly-`0` residual. Note what that means for the
    convention paragraph above: the factor-of-2 question and the Nei/Hudson question are
    precisely what the simulation could NOT answer, because the estimator it compared
    against carried the corpus's own convention in its definition of `fst`. UNTESTED as a

## Ancestry-Specific LD Tagging

The same causal variant may be tagged by different GWAS variants
in different ancestries due to population-specific LD.
-/

section LDTagging

/-- Apparent effect recovered through a tag at LD correlation `tagR` to the
causal variant.

    Regime: one causal variant, one tag, both standardized; the apparent effect
    is the tag's MARGINAL regression coefficient.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED** (`simcov/battery_bulk22.py`, `group_b`).
    One causal variant and one tag at correlation `r`, both standardized, over
    2×10⁶ individuals; the observable is the tag's REALISED marginal OLS slope.
    `r` is swept from 0.3 to 0.9, over which `r` and `r²` separate threefold.

      β_c    r     this body   realised slope   sems
      0.3   0.9     0.270000      0.269586       0.61
      0.3   0.5     0.150000      0.150119       0.17
      0.5   0.7     0.350000      0.350293       0.44
      0.2   0.3     0.060000      0.060220       0.31

    The identity gate is carried: the squared form `β_c · r²` is run on the SAME
    cells and misses by 39 to 159 sems — at `r = 0.3` it predicts 0.018 against
    a measured 0.0602 — and the positive control, the causal variant's own
    slope, which must be `β_c`, passes at 0.02 sems. A match with no rejected
    competitor would have measured nothing.

    CORRECTED. This body previously took squared LD. Regressing the phenotype
    on the tag recovers
    `Cov(g_tag, y) = β_c · r`, and a standardized tag has unit variance, so no
    second factor of `r` divides it out. Both forms were carried on the same
    cells, so the exponent was chosen by the data and not by the parameter's
    name.

    `r²` remains the right argument for quantities QUADRATIC in the effect --
    the variance a tag explains is `β_c² · r²`, and there the square belongs.
    It is the linear effect that takes `r`. The sign matters too and `r²`
    discards it: two tags in equal-magnitude but opposite-sign LD carry
    apparent effects of opposite sign. -/

/-- **Tag SNP may differ across populations.**
    If tag_source is the best proxy for causal variant C in the source,
    and tag_target is the best proxy in the target,
    these may be different SNPs entirely. Their apparent effects agree exactly
    when the causal effect is null or the two tags have the same LD correlation.

    The discriminating parameter is the CORRELATION and not its square: two tags
    with equal `r²` but opposite sign carry apparent effects of opposite sign,
    which this statement now separates and the `r²` form could not. -/

/-- **LD tagging efficiency.**
    The proportion of heritability captured by GWAS depends on
    how well the genotyped SNPs tag causal variants:
    h²_GWAS = h²_true × average_r²_tag.

    Regime: `h²_true` is the heritability the effects actually carry, not a
    nominal per-effect variance times a locus count. The distinction is not
    pedantic and it is what a measurement of this definition turns on -- see
    below.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_dis1.py`). 100000 individuals,
    300 causal variants each tagged by one variant at correlation `rho`,
    heritability captured by regressing the outcome on the TAGS, with the
    in-sample `R²` corrected for its `m/n` optimism:

      design              this def   captured
      h² = 0.5, rho = 0.9  0.40590   0.40681 ± 0.00257   (0.35 sems)
      h² = 0.5, rho = 0.6  0.18777   0.18793 ± 0.00119   (0.14 sems)
      h² = 0.8, rho = 0.8  0.51355   0.50972 ± 0.00322   (1.19 sems)

    **A retraction** (`battery_bulk5.py`). That battery reported this definition
    FALSIFIED at 42 sems and 23 percent low. The report is withdrawn: it drew 60
    effects from `N(0, h²/M)` and then compared against the NOMINAL `h²`. The
    realised heritability of 60 such draws scatters by `sqrt(2/60)`, about 18
    percent, which is the whole of the reported error -- the same runs agree to
    0.35 sems once `h²_true` is read as the heritability the drawn effects
    actually produce. The definition never claimed to know what a finite draw
    would realise.

    Power: the prediction spans 0.18777 to 0.51355 across the design.

    **The exponent is chosen by the data** (`simcov/battery_bulk29.py`,
    `group_b`), which the run above did not establish. An independent design --
    200 causal variants each with one tag, the phenotype built from the CAUSAL
    variants and the score fitted on the TAGS, 300000 individuals -- reproduces
    this body at worst 3.51 sems (1.2% relative) with `r` swept 0.3 to 0.9.
    Carried on the same cells, the UNSQUARED form `h²_true · r` is FALSIFIED at
    up to 652 sems (225% relative). So the square is not a convention: a tag
    recovers heritability, which is quadratic in the effect, through `r²`, while
    it recovers the EFFECT itself through `r` -- see `taggedEffect`, where the
    corpus had the exponents the other way round. -/

### Derivation: fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium = 1/(1 + 4·Ne·m) from migration-drift balance

The island model equilibrium Fst is already derived in two places:

1. **PortabilityDrift.lean**: `fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium` is derived from the
   migration-drift fixed point equation. At equilibrium, the increase in Fst from
   drift (ΔFst_drift = (1 - Fst)/(2N)) balances the decrease from migration
   (ΔFst_migration = -m·Fst·(2 - m)), yielding Fst_eq = 1/(1 + 4Nm).

2. **PopulationGeneticsFoundations.lean**: `fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium` provides the same
   formula with additional properties (positivity, monotonicity in migration).

The definition below is identical to both. We prove this equality explicitly.
-/

/-- **One generation of gene flow against drift**, in the architecture file's
argument order.

This is `Calibrator.ibdFlowStep` with the homogenising force taken to be
migration: `F` is the probability that two gene copies from the same population
are identical by descent, drift adds `(1 - F)/(2 Nₑ)` and migration removes
`2 m F`.  It is written here, rather than only in `PortabilityDrift`, because
the obligation to derive `fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium` belongs to the file that states it;
`geneFlowFstStep_eq_ibdFlowStep` records that it is the same map.

Composition convention: drift and gene flow are added, not composed, which is
the weak-migration/large-`Nₑ` first-order model.  The unlinearised multiplicative
recursion `islandFstMultiplicativeStep` has a different fixed point.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**, including the argument
    forwarding (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk14.py`).
    Wright-Fisher forward simulation, 4000 loci, 300 replicate populations, one
    generation of drift plus gene flow from a fixed source pool, `F` read as
    `1 - H/H_ancestral`:

      Ne     rate     this def   simulated            sems
      200    0.002     0.07045   0.07050 ± 0.00028     0.15

      200    0.010     0.05502   0.05497 ± 0.00022     0.22

    The forwarding is the point of the test. This definition's signature is
    `(m Ne F)` while the `ibdFlowStep` it delegates to is `(Ne rate F)`, so the
    first two arguments are exchanged in the call and a wrapper that failed to
    exchange them would be indistinguishable by eye. The battery calls this
    definition at its OWN order with the rate and `Ne` five orders apart: a
    transposed forwarding would return 205.61, 72.20 and 25.88 against a
    measurement near 0.05. The forwarding is correct, and it is now correct for
    a reason that a reader can check against numbers.

### Derivation: portabilityFromArchitecture = rg² × (1 - Fst) × tagging_ratio

The portability ratio R²_target / R²_source decomposes into three multiplicative
factors. This decomposition follows from the covariance model of PGS transfer:

**Step 1: Cross-population covariance decomposition.**
  R²_target = [Cov(PGS, Y_target)]² / [Var(PGS) × Var(Y_target)]

The cross-population covariance Cov(PGS, Y_target) factorizes because PGS weights
are fixed from the source GWAS while genotype-phenotype associations in the target
depend on allele frequencies and LD:

  Cov(PGS, Y_target) = rg × Cov_source × freq_correlation × ld_overlap

where:
- **rg** (genetic correlation): bounds the cross-population genetic covariance
  via Cauchy-Schwarz. If Cov_g(source, target) = rg × √(Vg_s × Vg_t), then
  the transferable signal is scaled by rg. (See GeneticArchitectureDiscovery.lean:
  `genetic_correlation_bounded` for the Cauchy-Schwarz bound.)

- **freq_correlation ≈ (1 - Fst)**: allele frequency divergence reduces the
  covariance between source PGS weights and target genotypes. The per-locus
  contribution is E[β × G_target] ∝ β × 2p_target, and the correlation between
  source and target allele frequencies is (1 - Fst). (See PortabilityDrift.lean:
  `covarianceRetentionFactorFromFst`.)

- **ld_overlap ≈ tagging_ratio**: the fraction of causal-variant LD captured
  by GWAS tag SNPs in the target population. Different LD patterns mean the
  tag SNP may not proxy the causal variant as well. (See PortabilityDrift.lean:
  `ldOverlapFromSharedLD`.)

**Step 2: Why the factors multiply.**
Frequency divergence and LD decay are independent processes:
- Frequency changes are driven by per-locus drift (a function of Fst).
- LD differences are driven by recombination and demographic history.

Because they act on orthogonal aspects of the covariance (per-locus variance
scaling vs. tag-causal correlation), their effects multiply. This is formalized
in PortabilityDrift.lean as `covarianceRetention`:
  covarianceRetention freq_corr ld_overlap = freq_corr × ld_overlap
                                           = (1 - Fst) × shared_LD

**Step 3: Squaring gives the R² ratio.**
Since R² ∝ Cov², the rg factor enters squared:
  R²_target / R²_source = rg² × (1 - Fst) × tagging_ratio

(The (1 - Fst) and tagging_ratio terms are already ratios of variance components,
so they enter linearly rather than squared in the R² ratio.)

This matches the already-derived `covarianceDivergenceFromRetention` in
PortabilityDrift.lean, which shows divergence = 1 - (1 - Fst) × shared_LD,
so retention = (1 - Fst) × shared_LD = (1 - Fst) × tagging_ratio.
