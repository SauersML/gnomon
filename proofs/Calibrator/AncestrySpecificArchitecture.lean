## Allele Frequency Divergence

Allele frequency differences between populations are the
most fundamental driver of PGS portability issues.

### Derivation of expectedFreqDiffSq = 2·Fst·p₀(1-p₀)

Under the Wright-Fisher model, genetic drift causes allele frequencies
to fluctuate randomly across generations. For a single population
diverging from an ancestor with allele frequency p₀:

  Var(p_t - p₀) = p₀(1-p₀) × Fst(t)

This **is** the definition of Fst: the proportion of total allelic
variance (p₀(1-p₀)) that lies between populations.

**Single-population drift variance:**
  driftVariance(p₀, Fst) = p₀·(1-p₀)·Fst

**Two-population divergence:**
Consider two populations (pop₁, pop₂) that diverged independently
from the same ancestral population with frequency p₀. Their allele
frequency deviations (p₁ - p₀) and (p₂ - p₀) are independent
because drift is driven by independent sampling in each lineage.

  E[(p₁ - p₂)²] = Var(p₁ - p₂)          (since E[p₁ - p₂] = 0)
                 = Var(p₁) + Var(p₂)      (independence of drift)
                 = p₀(1-p₀)·Fst + p₀(1-p₀)·Fst
                 = 2·p₀(1-p₀)·Fst

The factor of 2 arises because **both** lineages drift independently,
so the variance of their difference is the sum of their individual
drift variances.

## Ancestry-Specific LD Tagging

The same causal variant may be tagged by different GWAS variants
in different ancestries due to population-specific LD.

## Allelic Heterogeneity

At the same locus, different populations may harbor different
causal variants due to independent mutation and selection.
-/

section AllelicHeterogeneity

/-- **Allelic heterogeneity reduces portability via variance decomposition.**
    Total locus variance in source = V_shared + V_source_specific.
    The tag SNP captures r²_tag of source total variance.
    In target, only the shared component transfers: target variance
    at the tag = r²_tag × V_shared = r²_tag × ρ × V_total,
    where ρ = V_shared / V_total < 1 due to population-specific variants.

    Derived: r2_causal * r2_tag * ρ < r2_causal * r2_tag because
    multiplying the positive quantity r2_causal * r2_tag by ρ < 1
    strictly reduces it. -/

/-- **Population-specific rare variants at shared loci.**
    A gene may be important for a trait in all populations,
    but the specific damaging variants differ because rare
    mutations are recent and population-specific.

    Model: gene-level variance = v_shared + v_pop_specific.
    Both populations have positive gene-level variance (the gene
    matters in both), but the population-specific components may differ.

    Derived: both gene-level variances are strictly greater than
    the shared component alone, demonstrating that population-specific
    rare variants contribute genuine additional signal in each population.
    A PGS trained in EUR captures v_shared + v_eur_specific but only
    v_shared transfers to AFR, missing v_afr_specific entirely. -/

    may reveal secondary signals. If secondary signals are
    population-specific, this indicates allelic heterogeneity.

    Model: each population has n_signals total independent signals
    at a locus, of which n_shared are shared. The population-specific
    signal count is n_signals - n_shared.

    Derived: when both populations have signals and some are shared
    (0 < n_shared ≤ min(n_eur, n_afr)), the union of distinct signals
    (n_eur + n_afr - n_shared) exceeds each population's count alone,

### Derivation: equilibriumFst = 1/(1 + 4·Ne·m) from migration-drift balance

The island model equilibrium Fst is already derived in two places:

1. **PortabilityDrift.lean**: `fstMigrationDriftEquilibrium` is derived from the
   migration-drift fixed point equation. At equilibrium, the increase in Fst from
   drift (ΔFst_drift = (1 - Fst)/(2N)) balances the decrease from migration
   (ΔFst_migration = -m·Fst·(2 - m)), yielding Fst_eq = 1/(1 + 4Nm).

2. **PopulationGeneticsFoundations.lean**: `islandModelFst` provides the same
   formula with additional properties (positivity, monotonicity in migration).

The definition below is identical to both. We prove this equality explicitly.
-/

### Derivation: portabilityFromArchitecture = rg² × (1 - Fst) × tagging_ratio

The portability ratio R²_target / R²_source decomposes into three multiplicative
factors. This decomposition follows from the covariance model of PGS transfer:

**Step 1: Cross-population covariance decomposition.**
  R²_target = [Cov(PGS, Y_target)]² / [Var(PGS) × Var(Y_target)]

The cross-population covariance Cov(PGS, Y_target) factorizes because PGS weights
are fixed from the source GWAS while genotype-phenotype associations in the target
depend on allele frequencies and LD:

  Cov(PGS, Y_target) = rg × Cov_source × freq_correlation × ld_overlap

where:
- **rg** (genetic correlation): bounds the cross-population genetic covariance
  via Cauchy-Schwarz. If Cov_g(source, target) = rg × √(Vg_s × Vg_t), then
  the transferable signal is scaled by rg. (See GeneticArchitectureDiscovery.lean:
  `genetic_correlation_bounded` for the Cauchy-Schwarz bound.)

- **freq_correlation ≈ (1 - Fst)**: allele frequency divergence reduces the
  covariance between source PGS weights and target genotypes. The per-locus
  contribution is E[β × G_target] ∝ β × 2p_target, and the correlation between
  source and target allele frequencies is (1 - Fst). (See PortabilityDrift.lean:
  `freqCorrFromFst`.)

- **ld_overlap ≈ tagging_ratio**: the fraction of causal-variant LD captured
  by GWAS tag SNPs in the target population. Different LD patterns mean the
  tag SNP may not proxy the causal variant as well. (See PortabilityDrift.lean:
  `ldOverlapFromSharedLD`.)

**Step 2: Why the factors multiply.**
Frequency divergence and LD decay are independent processes:
- Frequency changes are driven by per-locus drift (a function of Fst).
- LD differences are driven by recombination and demographic history.

Because they act on orthogonal aspects of the covariance (per-locus variance
scaling vs. tag-causal correlation), their effects multiply. This is formalized
in PortabilityDrift.lean as `covarianceRetention`:
  covarianceRetention freq_corr ld_overlap = freq_corr × ld_overlap
                                           = (1 - Fst) × shared_LD

**Step 3: Squaring gives the R² ratio.**
Since R² ∝ Cov², the rg factor enters squared:
  R²_target / R²_source = rg² × (1 - Fst) × tagging_ratio

(The (1 - Fst) and tagging_ratio terms are already ratios of variance components,
so they enter linearly rather than squared in the R² ratio.)

This matches the already-derived `covarianceDivergenceFromRetention` in
PortabilityDrift.lean, which shows divergence = 1 - (1 - Fst) × shared_LD,
so retention = (1 - Fst) × shared_LD = (1 - Fst) × tagging_ratio.
-/

/-- **portabilityFromArchitecture factors through covarianceRetention.**
    The (1 - Fst) × tagging_ratio component equals the covariance retention
    derived in PortabilityDrift.lean from the independence of allele frequency
    drift and LD decay. This connects the architecture-level formula to the
    derivation chain: covarianceRetention → covarianceDivergenceFromRetention. -/

/-- **Portability equals rg² × (1 - divergence), where divergence is derived.**
    covarianceDivergenceFromRetention fst tagging = 1 - (1-fst)×tagging,
