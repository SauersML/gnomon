# Two demographic spike laws, separated by convention

`Calibrator.PCCorrectability.ImitationCapacity` proves that the corpus's
`demographicSpike` is the trace-window certificate increment: a spike level
times the spike load of the centered subgroup contrast, the load being
`effectiveSubgroupSize`. That algebraic statement deliberately carries an
abstract real coordinate `F`; it cannot decide which population-genetic
differentiation functional a biological analysis supplied.

There are two legitimate specializations, and conflating them causes an almost
twofold error at weak differentiation:

* `neiContrastSpike` is an exact per-frequency identity. Four times Nei's
  `G_ST` is the standardized allele-frequency contrast variance.
* `hudsonBbpSpike` is the empirical PC/BBP law. The validation experiment used
  genuine ratio-of-averages Hudson `F_ST` and recovered coefficient
  `3.9920 ± 0.0045` against the theoretical `4`.

The exact conversion is `Hudson = 2G/(1+G)`, so the Hudson-calibrated spike is
`8G/(1+G)` times the subgroup load, not `4G` times that load. This module wires
both laws to the same certificate geometry while keeping their biological
meanings separate.

The module exists as a separate file for an import reason and not a conceptual
one: `Conventions` imports `StratificationConfounding`, which imports
`PCCorrectability`, so `ImitationCapacity` cannot import `Conventions` without
a cycle.  The composition therefore lives downstream of both.

section DemographicCapacity

/-- **The spike level of a subgroup contrast**: the variance of the
standardized allele-frequency contrast between the two subgroups.

This is the level of the exact Nei-normalized allele-frequency contrast. It is
written as a quantity rather than as an ambiguously named `F_ST` multiple:
`contrastSpikeLevel_eq_four_neiGst` derives it from
`Conventions.four_neiGst_eq_standardizedContrastVariance` instead of
stipulating it.

    Empirical status: DERIVED as an identity for Nei's `G_ST`; distinct from
    the empirically validated Hudson BBP level. -/

/-- **contrastSpikeLevel at its junk point, named.** The divisor is `p̄ (1 - p̄)` inside
`meanAlleleFreq`, which vanishes when both populations are fixed. Numerator and denominator
vanish together and Lean returns `0`: no contrast spike, which a locus with identical
intermediate frequencies also gives. The guard is not visible in this definition's own body, so
reading this line does not reveal that a branch exists. Consumers must exclude the argument that
makes the guard vanish. -/

/-- **No contrast, no spike.** Two populations at the same allele frequency produce a level of
exactly zero, whatever the frequency is. The proportionality to Nei's `G_ST` fixes the scale;
this fixes the origin, and a body with an additive offset would satisfy the first and not this. -/

/-- **The exact Nei contrast law composed with the certificate load.**

`contrastSpikeLevel` is the exact allele-frequency contrast level; the
trace-window spike load of the
subgroup-contrast direction is the load, pinned to `effectiveSubgroupSize` by
`dot_demographicSpikeDirection`.  Neither factor is a free parameter and no
numeral appears. -/

/-- **The exact Nei contrast spike written without a free coefficient.**

The spike level is the standardized contrast variance, pinned by
`four_neiGst_eq_standardizedContrastVariance`, so a bare constant such as `2`
cannot stand in for it. The load is the trace-window spike load of the
subgroup-contrast direction, pinned by `dot_demographicSpikeDirection`.  Both
factors are quantities rather than names, and their equality is proved directly. -/

/-- **The imitation criterion for the empirically calibrated stratification
spike.**

A demographic spike between two subgroups with allele frequencies `p₁` and `p₂`
is a legal member of the trace-window background class — undetectable at any
sample size, by any procedure — exactly when the certificate increment fits
inside the budget.  Nothing here is a spectral quantity: `bbpProxyThreshold`
does not appear, because the imitation question does not involve it. -/

/-- **The correction to the empirically Hudson-calibrated
`pcCorrectabilityMargin`, stated on genotypes.**

With `F` pinned to genuine Hudson `F_ST`, the sign of the existing margin is the
detectability criterion exactly when the trace window is active at the
baseline.  Away from that case the criterion is
`stratificationCertificateMargin`, which carries the headroom the existing
quantity omits. -/
