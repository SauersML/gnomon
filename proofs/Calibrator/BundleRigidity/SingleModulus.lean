# Single-atom modulus families, and a correction to the classification

This module is **self-contained: it imports only Mathlib**, so it sits outside the
in-flight dependency refactor.

## The question

Fix `v ≥ 0`. Which standardized finite distributions have **all their modulus values
equal to `v`** — that is, `|a j ^ 2 - 1| = v` for every atom `j`, so that the transfer
measure is the single atom `δ v`?

"Standardized" means the masses are positive, sum to one, and give mean zero and variance
one. "Distinct" means the atom values are pairwise different, which is what makes the
number of atoms `d` a well-posed quantity rather than an artefact of listing an atom
twice.

## The classification, corrected

An upstream note claimed:

> `TT t = δ v` with `v > 0` holds **iff** `d = 4`, with atoms `± √(1+v)`, `± √(1-v)` and
> masses `(1/4 + c√(1-v), 1/4 - c√(1-v), 1/4 - c√(1+v), 1/4 + c√(1+v))`; **no `d ≤ 3`
> family exists for `v > 0`.**

**The solution line is right. The `d ≤ 3` impossibility is false, and this module refutes
it with an explicit witness.**

`d = 3` families exist for *every* `0 < v < 1`. Take

```
atoms   =  ( √(1+v),  -√(1+v),  -√(1-v) )
masses  =  ( 1/4 + B/(4A),  1/4 - B/(4A),  1/2 )      A = √(1+v),  B = √(1-v)
```

Every mass is strictly positive, because `B < A`. At `v = 3/5` this is `A = 2B` with
`B² = 2/5`, and the masses are exactly `(3/8, 1/8, 1/2)` — see
`threeAtomWitness_threeFifths`, which is rational arithmetic and needs no square-root
manipulation at all.

### Two witnesses, and they are two *different* defects

The refutation has two witnesses, and it matters that they are **not two instances of one
mistake**. They are two independent failures of different kinds, and only the first could
have been caught by being more careful with the existing argument.

1. **`0 < v < 1` (`threeAtom`, and `threeAtomWitness_threeFifths` at `v = 3/5`) — a
   boundary mishandled.** This family *is* expressible in the upstream parameterization:
   it is the closed endpoint `|c| = 1/(4√(1+v))` of the very `c`-line the upstream
   statement writes down. The upstream text restricted to "`|c|` small enough for
   positivity" and then asserted the endpoints were empty. The parameter interval is
   closed and its endpoints are families. A careful redo of the same argument finds this.

2. **`v = 1` (`threeAtomAtOne`) — a case the method cannot express.** This one is *not* a
   point of the `c`-line. At `v = 1` the two `(1-v)`-side atoms collide at zero, so `d = 4`
   is impossible outright (`card_le_three_of_v_eq_one`) and the three-atom family
   `(√2, -√2, 0)` with masses `(1/4, 1/4, 1/2)` is the *only* family there. The upstream
   argument turns on the ratio `√((1+v)/(1-v))`, which **divides by zero at `v = 1`**, so
   the case was never reachable by it at all.

**The second is the more serious kind.** No amount of care with the existing argument
would have found it, because the argument has no value to take at that point. A defect of
type 1 is a slip; a defect of type 2 says the method's domain of validity was never
checked against the domain of the claim.

### Where the upstream argument went wrong, precisely

The upstream proof deleted an atom and derived a negative mass. It deleted a
**`(1-v)`-side** atom: setting `x' = 0` forces `y - y' = -(1/2)√((1+v)/(1-v))`, and since
that ratio exceeds one, `y < 0`. That case is genuinely impossible and the argument for it
is correct.

But the **other** deletion was never checked. Delete a `(1+v)`-side atom — equivalently
set the mass at `√(1-v)` to zero — and the forced value is
`x - x' = √((1-v)/(1+v)) / 2`, whose ratio is **less than** one, so
`x' = 1/4 - B/(4A) > 0`. Every remaining mass is positive. The sign of the inequality
flips with the direction of the deletion, and only one direction was examined.

Structurally: `d = 3` is not a separate case at all. It is the **endpoint of the same
one-parameter line**. The upstream parameter `c` ranges over `|c| ≤ 1/(4√(1+v))`; the
interior gives `d = 4`, and the two endpoints `c = ±1/(4√(1+v))` are exactly the two
`d = 3` families, obtained when the mass at `∓√(1-v)` reaches zero. The upstream
statement quietly restricted to the open interval ("for `|c|` small enough for
positivity") and then asserted the closed endpoints were empty.

### What survives

* `v > 1` is impossible (`v_le_one`) — proved here in general `d`.
* the side masses are forced to be `1/2` and `1/2` (`sideMass_eq_half`) — proved here in
  general `d`, and this is the load-bearing step of the whole classification.
* `d = 2` is impossible for `v > 0` (`two_atom_forces_v_zero`) — proved here, in full,
  with no case left unchecked. This part of the upstream claim is correct.
* `v = 0` is the Rademacher case.

## Method note

This correction is an **executed falsifier, not a named one**. The upstream claim was a
universal negative ("no `d ≤ 3` family exists"), and a universal negative is refuted by
one witness. The witness is exhibited, its four defining identities are checked, and its
masses are rational. A search that reports "no such family" is informative only if it is
known capable of finding one; `threeAtomWitness_threeFifths` is the positive control that
the upstream search failed.

## Attribution

Nothing in this module is deep. It is finite algebra: a two-way case split on
`a² ∈ {1+v, 1-v}`, one linear equation from the variance identity, one from the mean. It
is recorded because a false universal claim was about to be built on.

The atoms are confined to at most four values, and at `v = 1` to at most three, because
the two `(1-v)`-side values collide at zero. That collision is the second defect in the
upstream classification: its ratio `√((1+v)/(1-v))` divides by zero at `v = 1`, so the
case was never reachable by its argument at all.

/-! ## The refutation: `d = 3` families exist for every `0 < v < 1`

The construction, and then the rational witness at `v = 3/5`.
-/

/-- **A three-atom single-modulus family**, for any `0 < v < 1`.

Atoms `A, -A, -B` with `A = √(1+v)`, `B = √(1-v)`; masses
`1/4 + B/(4A)`, `1/4 - B/(4A)`, `1/2`. Positivity of the second mass is exactly `B < A`,
which is exactly `v > 0`.

**This refutes the upstream claim that no `d ≤ 3` family exists for `v > 0`.** It is the
`c = 1/(4A)` endpoint of the upstream one-parameter line, at which the mass on `√(1-v)`
reaches zero and the atom disappears — not a new solution, but an endpoint of the known
one that the upstream positivity analysis excluded by assumption.

Parameterized by the **ratio** `r = B / A` rather than by a quotient written inline: the
masses are then `1/4 + r/4`, `1/4 - r/4`, `1/2`, and the construction contains **no
division at all**. Positivity of the middle mass is exactly `r < 1`, which is exactly
`B < A`, which is exactly `v > 0`. This shape was adopted after a build showed the
divided form failing on renamed division lemmas; it is the same family.

/-- **The rational witness at `v = 3/5`**, which needs no square-root manipulation: with
`B² = 2/5` and `A = 2B`, the masses are exactly `(3/8, 1/8, 1/2)`.

This is the positive control. A search that reports "no `d = 3` family exists for `v > 0`"
must find this one, and the upstream search did not. -/

/-- **The `v = 1` family: atoms `(√2, -√2, 0)` with masses `(1/4, 1/4, 1/2)`.**

At `v = 1` the value `√(1-v)` is zero, so the two `(1-v)`-side atoms of the upstream
parameterization collide and `d = 4` becomes impossible
(`SingleModulus.card_le_three_of_v_eq_one`). What remains is this single family, and it
is genuinely a family: all three masses are positive, the mean is zero because the
`±√2` atoms carry equal mass, and the variance is `(1/4)·2 + (1/4)·2 + 0 = 1`.

This is a **second, independent** counterexample to the upstream `d ≤ 3` impossibility,
and a sharper one: it is not a boundary point of the `c`-line but a case the upstream
argument could not have reached at all, since the ratio `√((1+v)/(1-v))` on which that
argument turns is undefined at `v = 1`. -/

Atoms `A, -A, B, -B` with masses `1/4 + cB, 1/4 - cB, 1/4 - cA, 1/4 + cA`. The mean
identity holds for *every* `c` — the two cross terms `cAB` cancel identically — and the
variance identity is insensitive to `c` for the same reason. So `c` is a genuinely free
parameter, and the only constraint is positivity: `|c| * A < 1/4`.

At the endpoints `|c| * A = 1/4` one mass vanishes and the family drops to the `d = 3`
family above. That is the whole correction, in one sentence: the parameter interval is
**closed**, and its endpoints are families, not empty. -/

## The three families, with no parameter left free

Each construction above still takes its atoms abstractly -- `threeAtomWitness_threeFifths`
wants a `B` with `B² = 2/5`, `threeAtomAtOne` an `A` with `A² = 2`, `fourAtom` both. A
construction parameterized that way refutes nothing on its own: the caller still has to
supply the square roots, and until someone does, the correction to the upstream `d ≤ 3`
claim is a family conditional on an unmet hypothesis rather than an existence statement.

The three corollaries below supply them, so the counterexamples stand as closed claims.
They are separate from `SingleModulus.nonempty`, which is about `SingleModulus 2 0`; these
inhabit `3 (3/5)`, `3 1` and `4 v` for `0 < v < 1`, which are the cases the upstream
`d ≤ 3` impossibility claim covers.
