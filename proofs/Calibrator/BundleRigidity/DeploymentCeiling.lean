# Discharging the deployment-ceiling premise, and the cost it actually carries

This module is **self-contained: it imports only Mathlib.** It does not import
`FoldedSpectrum`; all ceiling statements here are derived from the concrete model below.

## What was assumed, and what is discharged here

An earlier interface accepted the desired ceiling characterization as a structure field.
That interface has been removed: a biconditional between unconstrained reals is not a
scientific theorem.  `DeploymentModel` instead defines the quantities and proves the
forward implication internally.

## The model, and the forward direction

A deployment direction is blind at coupling order `k` when order-`k` data cannot see it.
`blind k` is the residual risk invisible at order `k`, and `perpRisk` — the *absolutely*
blind residual — is bounded by every one of them.

The forward conjunct is then **short, and that is the honest headline**:
`perpRisk_eq_zero_of_blind_eq_zero` says that if blindness vanishes at *any single* finite
order, the absolutely-blind residual is zero. Combined with the coverage-invariance
theorem — peelable base plus `η > 0` gives coupled `k`-point injectivity with
`σ_min ≥ (η/C)^k`, and injectivity at order `k` is exactly `blind k = 0` — this gives

> **`η > 0` ⟹ `perpRisk = 0`.**

So the first conjunct is *derivable* rather than assumed, from
`BundleRigidity.CoverageInvariance.sigmaMin_pos` plus a detection lemma linking a positive
smallest singular value to zero blindness at that order. The detection lemma is the one
genuinely new input and it is carried as an explicit hypothesis (`hdetect`), not hidden.

## The finding: the cost is exponential in the coupling order, not quadratic in `1/η`

This is the part that changes how the headline should be quoted.

The corpus states the cost of positive support as `m ≥ d / (2·c₋·η²·R)` — quadratic in
`1/η`. That is the cost **at fixed coupling order**. But the only guarantee available is
`σ_min ≥ (η/C)^k`, which **decays geometrically in `k`**, and a direction resolved only at
coupling order `k` needs roughly `1/σ_min²` samples, i.e. `(C/η)^{2k}`.

`sampleCost_unbounded` proves that this exceeds **every** bound as `k` grows, whenever
`0 < η < C`.

So the qualitative claim survives exactly as stated — there is **no information-theoretic
floor**, every direction is visible at some finite order, and it *is* a sample-size problem
rather than a wall. But "sample-size problem" must not be read as "cheap". The sample size
is exponential in the coupling order a direction requires, and only the `k = 1` case is
quadratic in `1/η`. **A direction with large `r*` is a wall in practice while being a
sample-size problem in theory**, and the published formula does not show that, because it
is the fixed-order specialisation.

That is a refinement rather than a refutation, and it is falsifiable in the useful
direction: exhibit a deployment direction whose coupling order is large, and the quoted
cost formula understates the requirement by an exponential factor.

## What remains assumed

The **converse** — `perpRisk = 0 ⟹ η > 0` — is not proved here and is not provable from
the coverage machinery, which says nothing when `η = 0`. It needs the modulus-copy
falsifier: at `η = 0` there is an infinite-dimensional 2-point kernel even with `T`
injective, so blindness is genuinely present. That witness is carried as the hypothesis
`hzero` of `characterization_of_model` and as `modulusCopyWitness` in
`BundleRigidity.CoverageInvariance`.

So after this module the premise is split into: one direction **derived**, one direction
resting on a **named witness that is known to exist**, and one detection lemma stated as an
explicit input. That is strictly better than a single opaque assumed biconditional, and it
localizes what is still owed.

`blind k` is the aggregate deployment risk that order-`k` data cannot see; `perpRisk` is the
absolutely-blind residual, the part no finite order sees. The only structural facts needed
are that risks are non-negative and that the absolutely-blind part is bounded by the

/-- **The forward conjunct, in its essential form.**

If blindness vanishes at *any single* finite coupling order, the absolutely-blind residual
is zero. There is no limit to take and no uniformity in `k` to establish: one order
suffices, because the absolutely-blind part is below every order's blindness. -/

    M.perpRisk = 0 :=

/-- **Positive conditional support removes the absolutely-blind residual.**

`hdetect` is the detection lemma: a strictly positive smallest singular value at order `k`
means order-`k` data sees everything, i.e. `blind k = 0`. The coverage-invariance theorem
supplies `0 < (η/C)^k` for every `k` whenever `0 < η` and `0 < C`
(`CoverageInvariance.sigmaMin_pos`), so the hypothesis fires and the conclusion follows at
order one.

This is the first conjunct of the boxed characterization, no longer assumed. -/

    M.perpRisk = 0 :=
  M.perpRisk_eq_zero_of_blind_eq_zero 1 (hdetect 1 (pow_pos (div_pos hη hC) 1))

/-- **The characterization, assembled from one derived direction and one witness.**

The forward direction is `perpRisk_eq_zero_of_eta_pos`. The converse rests on `hzero`, the
statement that vanishing support leaves genuine blindness — which is what the modulus-copy
falsifier exhibits at `η = 0`.

The `reversible ∨ arrowBit` conjunct of the original does not appear: the reversal
calculation already discharges it, so in the scalar stationary setting the characterization
is exactly this biconditional.

**QUOTE THIS ONLY WITH ITS COST QUALIFIER.** The reading "aggregate deployment risk has no
information-theoretic floor, so the portability gap is a sample-size problem, not a wall"
is correct and is what this theorem says. It must travel with:

> the sample size is **exponential in the coupling order** a direction requires
> (`sampleCost_unbounded`); only the order-one case is the quadratic `1/η²` formula
> (`sampleCost_one`).

A direction with large coupling order is a wall in practice while remaining a sample-size
problem in theory. The published `m ≥ d/(2 c₋ η² R)` is the fixed-order specialisation and
understates a high-order direction by an exponential factor.

**AND NOTE WHAT IS OUT OF SCOPE.** This says nothing about directions that are not
identifiable at *any* order. If an environmental gradient is collinear with the ancestry
gradient, a one-parameter family of genetic/environmental splits produces **identical**
cohort shifts — exactly equal, not approximately — so no cohort-level calibration separates
them at any sample size, and the level-set collapse carries that to every threshold metric.
That is a second and orthogonal kind of wall: this theorem is about how *expensive* a
visible direction is to resolve, and says nothing about a direction a design confined to one
ancestry axis cannot resolve at all. `η > 0` does not cover it, and `r⊥ = 0 ⟺ η > 0` must
not be read as covering it. -/

end DeploymentModel

/-! ## The converse is not a theorem here, and saying why is the point

An earlier revision of this module stated the full biconditional
`perpRisk = 0 ↔ 0 < η` as `characterization_of_model`, taking
`hzero : η = 0 → 0 < perpRisk` as a hypothesis. **It is removed**, and the reason is the
standard now applied corpus-wide: *if deleting the proof body and replacing it with the
hypothesis would produce the same theorem, there is no theorem.*

The two halves are not alike, and packaging them together disguised that:

* **`0 < η ⟹ perpRisk = 0` is derived.** It runs through
  `perpRisk_eq_zero_of_blind_eq_zero` — blindness vanishing at any *single* finite order
  kills the absolutely-blind residual — fed by coverage invariance, which supplies
  `σ_min ≥ (η/C)^k > 0` at every order. That is real content and it keeps a theorem's name
  (`perpRisk_eq_zero_of_eta_pos`, and its positive-`η` restatement above).
* **`perpRisk = 0 ⟹ 0 < η` was not.** Its entire content was the contrapositive of
  `hzero`. The proof case-split on `η = 0` and applied the hypothesis. Stating it as half
  of a biconditional made the derived half look stronger than it is, which is exactly the
  defect the sweep is removing elsewhere.

**What a proof of the converse would need.** The modulus-copy falsifier: at `η = 0` there
is an infinite-dimensional two-point kernel even when `T` is injective, so vanishing
support leaves genuine blindness. The corpus states that as a construction rather than a
hypothesis, so it is not obviously out of reach — but it is not formalized, and until it is
there is no biconditional here, only the forward implication and a named gap. -/

/-! ## The cost, which is where the interesting correction lives -/

/-- Samples needed to resolve a direction whose coupling order is `k`, from the only
available guarantee `σ_min ≥ (η/C)^k` and the usual `1/σ_min²` scaling. -/
noncomputable def sampleCost (η C : ℝ) (k : ℕ) : ℝ := (C / η) ^ (2 * k)

/-- **The sample cost is unbounded in the coupling order.**

For `0 < η < C` there is, for every bound `B`, a coupling order whose sample cost exceeds
it. So the guarantee supplied by positive support degrades geometrically in the order, and
the published cost `m ≥ d/(2 c₋ η² R)` — quadratic in `1/η` — is the **fixed-order**
specialisation rather than the general cost.

The qualitative headline is untouched: every direction is seen at some finite order, so
there is no information-theoretic floor. What this shows is that "a sample-size problem,
not a wall" must not be read as "a cheap problem": for a direction requiring large coupling
order the required sample size is exponential in that order. -/
