# Theorem D: finite cycles and the product-one criterion

This module is **self-contained: it imports only Mathlib**.

## The setting

Take distinct parameters `t₁, …, t_{2r}` with exact coincidences

```
m_{j_s}(t_s)  =  m_{k_s}(t_{s+1})        cyclically in `s`,
```

and write `ρ s = p_{j_s}(t_s) / p_{k_s}(t_{s+1})` for the mass ratio across the `s`-th
coincidence. An atomic kernel element assigns a weight `x s` to `t_s`, and each
coincidence forces

```
x (s+1)  =  - ρ s · x s.
```

**Theorem D.** Such a non-zero assignment exists **iff** `∏ ρ s = 1`, and the solution
space is then one-dimensional.

## What is actually proved here

The arithmetic core, in full and with no hypotheses:

* `iterate_eq` — going once around gives `x m = (-1)^m (∏_{s<m} ρ s) x 0`;
* `cycle_solvable_iff` — a non-zero cyclic solution exists iff `(-1)^n ∏ ρ = 1`;
* `cycle_solvable_iff_even` — for a cycle of **even** length `n = 2r`, the sign is `+1`,
  so the criterion is exactly `∏ ρ = 1`, as stated;
* `solution_unique_of_ne_zero` — the solution space is one-dimensional: any two solutions
  are proportional, since each is determined by its value at `0`.

The sign is not decoration. For an **odd** cycle the criterion is `∏ ρ = -1`, which
positive mass ratios can never satisfy — so odd cycles carry no atomic kernel element at
all, whatever the masses. That is `no_odd_cycle_of_pos`, and it is a consequence of the
same computation rather than a separate argument.

## Strong closure is a hypothesis, not a remark

The upstream statement was strengthened by its own proof: it needs **every branch value of
each `t_s` to be shared within the cycle**, not merely the `2r` coincidences that define
the cycle. Without that, a branch of some `t_s` lands on a modulus value reached nowhere
else in the cycle, that value is singly covered, and the peeling lemma kills the weight at
`t_s` outright — so no kernel element survives regardless of the product condition.

Strong closure therefore appears as the named field `strongClosure` of `CycleData`, in the
signature, not in prose. **It is the existence condition, not a regularity assumption**:
it is the finite shadow of value-closedness, and the product-one criterion is only
meaningful in its presence.

## Attribution

This is the classical **closed-path criterion** for sums of weighted compositions
(Diliberto–Straus, Marshall–O'Farrell, Ismailov), transported to weighted analytic branch
maps in one variable. The transport is the new part; the criterion is not.

/-- **Theorem D for an even cycle**, which is the stated case `n = 2r`.

The sign `(-1)^{2r}` is `+1`, so the criterion is exactly `∏ ρ = 1`. -/

/-- **Odd cycles carry nothing, whatever the masses.**

For a cycle of odd length the criterion reads `∏ ρ = -1`, and a product of positive mass
ratios is positive. So no atomic kernel element exists on an odd cycle — not because of
any condition on the weights, but because of the sign alone. -/

Any solution of the recursion is determined by its value at `0`, so two solutions with the

other. -/

/-! ## What is NOT stated here, and why there is no `theoremD`

Earlier revisions carried a `CycleData` structure with `coincidence : Prop` and
`strongClosure : Prop` fields, and a `theoremD` taking them as hypotheses. **Both are
removed, and the reason is worth recording, because the construction looked more honest
than it was.**

A field of type `Prop` does not *state* anything. `strongClosure : Prop` is a variable
ranging over propositions, satisfiable by `True`; it does not assert that every branch
value is shared within the cycle. So it could not be discharged — there was nothing to
prove — and it was not an external theorem either, because it named no theorem. It was a
label.

The `theoremD` that consumed it was worse in a specific way: its two hypotheses were
`_hclosure` and `_hcoinc`, underscore-prefixed because **the proof did not use them**, and
its body was literally `cycle_solvable_iff_even C.ratio r`. The signature advertised that
strong closure was doing work; nothing in the term depended on it. Anyone reading the
statement would conclude the corpus had formalized Theorem D. It had formalized the
recursion criterion and dressed it in Theorem D's hypotheses.

**What is genuinely proved is above and stands on its own**: `cycle_solvable_iff_even` (a
non-zero cyclic solution exists iff the ratios multiply to one), `no_odd_cycle_of_pos` (odd
cycles carry nothing, whatever the masses), and `solution_unique_of_ne_zero`
(one-dimensionality). These are facts about the recursion `x_{s+1} = -ρ_s x_s`, they need
no closure hypothesis, and they are complete.

**What is not proved is Theorem D itself** — the statement that *atomic kernel elements*
exist iff the product is one. That needs strong closure as a real hypothesis: without it a
branch of some `t_s` reaches a modulus value covered nowhere else in the cycle, that value
is singly covered, the peeling lemma kills the weight at `t_s`, and no kernel element
survives however the product comes out. Stating that in Lean requires either formalizing
value-closedness properly or carrying it as an unproved parameter. The second is no longer
permitted, and rightly, so the kernel-element form of Theorem D is **absent from this
module** rather than present in weakened dress.

The classical closed-path criterion this transports (Diliberto–Straus, Marshall–O'Farrell,
Ismailov) is cited in the header as background, not claimed as formalized. -/
