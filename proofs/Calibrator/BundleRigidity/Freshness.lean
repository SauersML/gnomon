# Effective independence dimension and the master decay bound

This module imports targeted Mathlib modules **and** `Calibrator.BundleRigidity.Realizability`.
It is therefore **no longer self-contained**, and the previous claim that it imports only
Mathlib is stale — the `Realizability` dependency was added after that sentence was
written, and the sentence is corrected here rather than left to contradict the header.

*On the import style, since it changed and the reason is not obvious from the diff.* Every
module in this directory originally began `import Mathlib` — the whole library at once.
That requires the root `Mathlib.olean`, which is **absent** from the cluster build, so
these modules could not be built at all while every other module in the corpus could. The
imports are now targeted, matching the rest of `proofs/Calibrator`, which needs no root
olean. This was a build-availability fix, not a cleanup.

## What this replaces

Everywhere else in this development, oscillatory decay was bought by factoring a
characteristic function as a **product over coordinates**. That step needs independence,
and under linkage disequilibrium it is false. The master bound below replaces it once a
genuine contraction of the partial joint expectation has been established.

## The right object is the actual joint amplitude

The object controlling decay is the modulus of the **joint** characteristic function.
A conditional-gain functional may be defined as its negative logarithm; the finite,
zero-safe definition is `Calibrator.FiniteCoupledPhaseLaw.conditionalGainFunctional`.

One must not replace the joint characteristic function by a product of one-coordinate
conditional expectations. That identity is false under dependence; the copied binary
counterexample is formalized in `Calibrator.copied_binary_refutes_conditional_product_identity`.
The telescope below therefore begins with `hstep`, an explicit contraction hypothesis on
the actual partial expectation.

`D` is only a sufficient bookkeeping device for a family of such contractions:

```
|E_n| ≤ exp (-θ γ D).
```

It is neither a necessary invariant of a coupling nor an evaluation of the joint gain.
No Gaussian-copula or deterministic-driving evaluation is asserted in this module.

## The quantity `D`

Fix an ordering of the coordinates. Write `ε i` for the per-coordinate contraction
available at step `i` in the conditional-gain sense above, and let `D` be the maximum over
orderings of `∑ i, ε i`. For independent coordinates every `ε i = 1` and `D` is the number
of coordinates; under strong dependence `D` collapses. It is a **lower-bound parameter**,
not a characterization.

## The master theorem

```
| E ∏ᵢ χ_s(t i, X i) |  ≤  exp( - θ · γ(s) · D )
```

with `θ = 1/2` in the current proof.

## The proof is a telescope, and that is why it formalizes cleanly

Condition on the past. The freshness bound splits the conditional law into an `ε` piece
that sees the reference measure and a `1 - ε` piece about which nothing is known, giving

```
|E(χ_s(X n) | past)|  ≤  (1 - ε n) + ε n · |∫ χ_s|  ≤  1 - ε n · γ n(s).
```

Iterating multiplies these, and `1 - x ≤ e^{-x}` converts the product into the
exponential. Both halves are proved here without hypotheses:

* `abs_le_prod_of_step` — the telescope itself, by induction;
* `prod_one_sub_le_exp_neg_sum` — the product-to-exponential conversion.

`master_decay_bound` composes them.

## The audit points, carried honestly

**(AP-α) — the constant is a parameter, not a baked-in `1/2`.** Sequential freshness is
**order-dependent**, and the factor `θ` absorbs the step where the worst half of the fibers
is discarded by Markov to obtain an average `γ`. Whether an order-free simultaneous
splitting improves `θ` beyond `1/2` is open. Because a failure there **weakens constants,
not statements**, `θ` appears as an explicit argument of `master_decay_bound`: any
improved discard constant is substituted without restating the theorem, and any collapse
of the argument shows up as a worse `θ` rather than as a false conclusion.

**(AP-β) — the band hypothesis.** The passage from a *pointwise kernel band* to an
*operator-norm bound on measures*, in the coupled slice theorem, is carried as the named
field `bandToOperatorNorm` of `CoupledSliceHypotheses`. It is not proved here.

The conditional step bound itself is likewise an input (`stepBound`): deriving it from a
genuine conditional law requires the disintegration machinery, which this module does not
carry. What the module *does* prove is that the step bound implies the master bound —
which is the whole of the telescope, and the part that was worth checking.

## Analytic realization is a separate obligation

The former slogan “continuation kills identities, not inequalities” is too coarse.
Analytic continuation constrains the entire labelled configuration wherever a connected
extension exists. It supplies uniqueness, not global existence: positivity, real-root
bounds, collision-free labelling, and exact window coverage must still be checked.

`symmetric_block_moments` proves the finite moment cancellation behind the
four-atom-per-block construction, while `symmetric_atoms_have_modulus` exposes its actual
domain `0 ≤ w ≤ 1`. Those synthetic atoms provide a useful operator stress test, but are
not automatically a Hardy--Weinberg genotype family.

**This does not reopen our own case.** The genotype family has more than two modulus
values, its cycle variety is empty, and M5 is unavailable for two independent reasons: the
image-free region the mechanism needs is empty, and the band has a single return generator
so the required composition cannot be formed.

/-- **The telescope.**

If each conditioning step contracts the partial expectation by a factor `1 - a k`, and the
initial expectation is bounded by one, then the `n`-th partial expectation is bounded by
the product of the contraction factors.

This is the entire iteration of the master theorem, proved by induction. The only sign
condition needed here is `a k ≤ 1`, which makes every contraction factor non-negative. -/

/-! ## The master decay bound -/

/-- **The master decay bound.**

`|E ∏ χ| ≤ exp(- ∑ θ · ε k · γ k)`, where `ε k` is the sequential freshness of coordinate
`k` and `γ k` the oscillation gain there.

**The discard constant `θ` is a parameter.** In the current proof `θ = 1/2`, coming from
the Markov step that throws away the worst half of the fibers to obtain an average `γ`.
Audit point AP-α asks whether an order-free simultaneous splitting improves it. Because it
is an argument rather than a literal, a better constant is substituted without restating
the theorem, and a failure of that argument degrades `θ` rather than falsifying anything.

The per-step contraction is the hypothesis `hstep`; deriving it from a genuine conditional
law needs disintegration, which this module does not carry. What is proved here is that
the step bound gives the exponential bound, for **any coupling whatsoever** — which is the
point of the theorem, and the step that replaces the product-of-characteristic-functions
argument everywhere downstream. -/

If the oscillation gain is uniform, `γ k = γ`, then the exponent is `θ · γ · D` with
`D = ∑ ε k` the freshness floor along the chosen ordering. Taking the
maximum over orderings gives `D` and hence the sharpest form of the bound.

For independent coordinates every `ε k = 1`, so `D = n` and the bound recovers the
classical product decay. Under dependence `D` collapses gracefully — which is exactly the
behaviour the product-of-characteristic-functions step could not express. -/

/-! ## The freshness floor `D`

Sequential freshness is **order-dependent**, so `D` is defined as the maximum of the total
freshness over all orderings of the coordinates. Orderings are permutations of `Fin n`;
the coordinate index stays a natural number so that these definitions plug directly into
the telescope above with no re-indexing.

theorem orderings_nonempty :

def dimSum (fresh : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → ℕ → ℝ) (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) : ℝ :=

/-- **The freshness floor** `D`: the maximum of total freshness over all orderings of the
coordinates.

It is a lower-bound parameter for the bound proved below, **not** a characterization of any
coupling invariant and **not** an "effective dimension". In particular it must not be cited
as an evaluation of the joint gain: the zero-safe conditional gain functional lives in
`Calibrator.ConditionalGain`, and the conditional-product identity that would have related
the two is false under dependence, refuted there by the copied-binary counterexample.

For independent coordinates every freshness is `1` and `D = n`. Under dependence `D`
collapses gracefully — it is the number of coordinates' worth of genuinely new randomness
the coupling still carries, and it is exactly the quantity the master bound decays in. -/

/-- **The positive control: independent coordinates give `D = n`.**

If every coordinate is fully fresh under every ordering — which is what independence says —
then `D` is exactly the number of coordinates, and the master bound below reduces to the
classical product decay `exp(-θγn)`.

This matters because the definition is otherwise only ever used to prove *upper* bounds on
decay. A quantity that can only shrink is informative only if it is known to attain its
maximum in the case where the classical argument applies, and this is that check. -/

floor on the conditional gain, sufficient and not necessary.

The hypotheses are taken along an **optimizing ordering** `σ`, which exists by
`effDim_attained`. No independence or regeneration is used in the telescope, but the
coupling must separately discharge the per-step contraction `hstep`; what is proved here
is that those contractions deliver exponential decay in `D`. -/
