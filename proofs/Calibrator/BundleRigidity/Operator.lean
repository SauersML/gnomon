# The bundle modulus operator, its mass identity, and symmetric families

This module is **self-contained: it imports only Mathlib**. It deliberately does not
import any other `Calibrator` module, so it can be read, checked and built on its own.

*On the import style, since it changed and the reason is not obvious from the diff.* This
module and its siblings originally began `import Mathlib`, pulling the whole library at
once. That requires the root `Mathlib.olean`. **Do not revert to the wholesale form**, for
three reasons, in increasing order of importance:

1. *cost.* The aggregate import makes every builder pay for the whole library, and
   targeted imports are why the rest of `proofs/Calibrator` builds in minutes instead of
   descending into thousands of Mathlib targets.
2. *single point of failure — the real argument.* The wholesale form made these modules'
   buildability depend on a **global artifact that nothing else in the corpus depended
   on**. When the root olean went missing, every other module still built and these
   eleven alone could not — and because they were the only ones affected, the fact went
   unnoticed for a long time while being reported as two separate problems ("these
   modules are never checked" and "the root is missing"), which were one problem. The
   targeted form puts this directory on the same footing as everything around it, so the
   next time the root is absent **nobody has to notice that these modules are special.**
3. *these modules are now foundational.* Files outside this directory are being wired to
   depend on them, so their import structure is load-bearing rather than local.

The root olean has since been rebuilt and the wholesale form would work again. That does
not restore the argument for it; reason 2 is about what happens the next time, not this
time.

## What is here

A **bundle family** on a parameter space `T` is a finite list of atoms `atom j t` with
masses `mass j t > 0` summing to one, standardized so that `∑ mass j t * atom j t = 0`
and `∑ mass j t * atom j t ^ 2 = 1`. One parameter `t` fixes every atom and every mass
simultaneously — that is what *bundle* means, and it is the entire source of rigidity.
The atoms cannot be reweighted one at a time.

The **modulus curve** is `modulusMap j t = |atom j t ^ 2 - 1|`, the value taken by
`|U|` for `U = X² - 1`. The family's **transfer measure** at `t` is
`TT t = ∑ j, mass j t • δ (modulusMap j t)`, and the operator studied here sends a
measure `κ` on parameters to `L κ = ∫ TT t dκ t`.

Measures are represented here **by the linear functionals they induce on continuous test
functions** — the Riesz picture. A measure is `κ : C(T, ℝ) →ₗ[ℝ] ℝ`. This is the right
level for everything in this module: the operator, its adjoint, the mass identity and the
symmetry theorem are all statements about pairing against test functions, and the Riesz
picture makes them short and complete rather than long and partial. The support-side
statements, which genuinely need measures as set functions, live in the companion
`Coverage` and `Peeling` modules and are stated there with their analytic inputs named.

In this picture the adjoint comes first and the operator is defined from it:
`coTransfer f t = ∑ j, mass j t * f (modulusMap j t)` is `L*`, and `L κ = κ ∘ L*`.

## Attribution — what is classical here and what is not

**Almost none of the machinery below is new, and this docstring is written so that no
later reader can mistake it for new.**

Bundle rigidity is the **measure-side dual of the classical theory of sums of weighted
compositions**: functions of the form `∑ p_j · (f ∘ m_j)`, studied by
**Diliberto and Straus**, by **Marshall and O'Farrell**, and by **Ismailov**. The peeling
argument formalized in the companion module is the classical **lightning-bolt argument**
— a path through the coincidence structure must close up before it can carry anything —
and the product-one cycle criterion of Theorem D is the standard **closed-path criterion**
of that literature, transported to weighted analytic branch maps in one variable.

What is genuinely new in this development, and all that should ever be claimed for it:

1. **the setting**: tied weights with moving analytic atoms. The classical theory takes
   the composition maps as given and the weights as free; here one parameter moves the
   atoms and their masses together, and the masses are pinned by the standardization
   identities. That case is not covered by the classical results;
2. **the complete `d = 2` solution**, with the peeling chain `P k = k / (2 * k + 1)`.
   That is formalized with no unproved hypotheses at all in the companion `TwoAtom`
   module;
3. **the tilt observation**: tilting by `|X| ^ (2θ)` moves only amplitudes and never
   phases, so oscillatory decay is bought once for every tilt simultaneously.

And one honest admission, which is a result of record rather than a gap to be filled
later: **there is no if-and-only-if criterion on wild cores.** An empty core is
sufficient for rigidity; no necessary-and-sufficient condition is claimed, here or
anywhere in this development.

## A structural limitation, recorded rather than fixed

The surrounding theory assumes **independent coordinates**. In the application domain
linkage disequilibrium is central, and dependence would break the
product-of-characteristic-functions step that the associated Cramér-type argument rests
on. This is a structural limitation of the method, not a generalization waiting to be
written. It is carried below as the named field `independentCoordinates` of
`StandingHypotheses`, so that any statement relying on the modelling reading has it in
its signature rather than in prose.

parameter simultaneously*, which is what ties the atoms into a bundle: no single atom can

`(L κ) [0, ∞) = κ T`. In the Riesz picture the total mass of a measure is its value on the
constant function `1`, and the identity is immediate from `L* 1 = 1`, which is the
statement that the bundle masses sum to one.

This is the foundation of the whole development: it is what makes the operator
mass-preserving rather than merely positive, and it is the reason a kernel element must be
a signed measure of total mass zero. It is also what kills the Rademacher point in
Theorem E. -/

in the kernel, and in particular `L` is injective on the *cone* of positive measures of a
fixed total mass as soon as it is injective on differences. -/

The most important theorem here for the application. If the family is invariant under a

on `T / τ`.

No hypothesis on the family beyond `IsSymmetry`; no analyticity, no coverage condition,

`TT ∘ τ = TT`, and a `τ`-odd measure annihilates every `τ`-invariant function.

**This is the detector.** Any search for kernel elements that works only with
`L*`-functionals and reports nothing on a symmetric family is inconsistent with this
theorem and is therefore broken. It is the positive control every rigidity search must
