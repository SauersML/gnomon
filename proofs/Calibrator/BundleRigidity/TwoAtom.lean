# Theorem E: the two-atom family, solved completely

This module is **self-contained: it imports only Mathlib**.

## The family

For `0 < p < 1` the two-atom standardized family is

```
atoms   =  ( -√((1-p)/p),  √(p/(1-p)) )
masses  =  ( p,  1-p )
```

whose modulus curves are

```
m₁ p  =  |1 - 2p| / p          m₂ p  =  |1 - 2p| / (1 - p).
```

This is the one case of the bundle rigidity problem that is **completely solved**, and it
is one of the three things this development may legitimately claim as new. Everything
below is proved outright: there are no named hypotheses and no `sorry` in this file.

## The reflection, and what it means biologically

The involution is `τ p = 1 - p`. It swaps the two branches — `m₁ ∘ τ = m₂` and
`m₂ ∘ τ = m₁` (`mOne_reflect`, `mTwo_reflect`) — and it swaps the two masses, so the
transfer measure is invariant: `TT ∘ τ = TT`. By Theorem B every `τ`-odd measure is in the
kernel, and Theorem E says that is *all* of the kernel.

**In population genetics this is a known fact with a name.** From unpolarized allele data
one recovers the site frequency spectrum only up to the ancestral/derived swap — the
**folded spectrum**. The machinery reproduces that independently, which is a validation of
the formalism rather than a discovery.

The contribution is *not* that polarization is unrecoverable; that was known. It is that
the **same peeling machinery** which yields this known fact goes on to decide
identifiability of the folded spectrum itself, on `(0, 1/2]`, which is not standard.

## The peeling chain

The quotient family on `(0, 1/2]` is rigid, and peeling reaches every point of it along

```
P k  =  k / (2k + 1),        P 1 = 1/3,  P 2 = 2/5,  P 3 = 3/7,  …  →  1/2.
```

The chain identity is the arithmetic verification

```
1 / P (k+1)  -  2   =   1 / (k+1)   =   (1 - 2 · P k) / (1 - P k),
```

which says exactly that **`m₁` at the next point equals `m₂` at the current point**:
`m₁ (P (k+1)) = m₂ (P k) = 1/(k+1)`. That common value is the link in the chain, and it is
what lets peeling step from `P k` to `P (k+1)`. Peeling therefore runs to order `ω`, and
the chain exhausts `(0, 1/2)`.

The remaining point `p = 1/2` is the **Rademacher point**, where both atoms are `±1` and
both modulus curves vanish. Peeling cannot reach it, because there is nothing left to
single-cover. It is killed instead by the **mass identity (0.4)**: a measure supported at
`1/2` alone is a multiple of `δ_{1/2}`, its image is the same multiple of `δ_0`, and
vanishing image forces the multiple to be zero (`rademacher_point_killed`). That is the
one place in the argument where the mass identity, rather than coverage, does the work.

## Audit point (AP-b): our family sits on a block-collision stratum, and the argument
## here does not depend on the framework that excludes them

The realizability framework's second pre-registered audit point is **block collisions** —
atom merging — where the sufficiency argument assumes a constant block pattern and is
currently proved *off* those isolated strata.

**This family sits on exactly such a stratum, and not incidentally.** At `p = 1/2` both
modulus curves vanish together (`mOne_half`, `mTwo_half`), so the distinct modulus values
collapse. That is a block collision, and it is the **accumulation point of the peeling
chain** (`chain_tendsto_half`), not an interior point one could exclude by hand.

So the inherited scope condition had to be checked rather than assumed. It clears, and here
is the specific reason:

* **the Rademacher point is killed by the mass identity, not by continuation.**
  `rademacher_point_killed` is pure arithmetic — `c · (p + (1 - p)) = c`, so a vanishing
  image forces `c = 0`. It invokes no analyticity, no germ, no block pattern and no
  continuation argument, so nothing about constant block patterns can affect it;
* **the chain never reaches the collision.** `chain_lt_half` proves every `P k` is strictly
  below `1/2`, so every peeling step happens strictly off the collision stratum, and the
  collision is approached only in the limit;
* **the peeling machinery used here is topological, not analytic.** The coverage and core
  results in `Coverage` use continuity of the modulus curves and monotonicity of peeling;
  they never use analyticity, so they carry no off-strata scope condition to inherit.

**Conclusion: nothing in this file's argument is inherited from the off-collision-strata
sufficiency claim.** This is recorded because an inherited scope condition is exactly the
kind of thing that goes unnoticed — the argument would still *read* correctly if it had
silently depended on one.

## Attribution

The two-atom solution is new here. The peeling argument it runs on is the classical
lightning-bolt argument from the theory of sums of weighted compositions
(Diliberto–Straus, Marshall–O'Farrell, Ismailov). The folded-spectrum conclusion is a
known fact in population genetics, reproduced rather than discovered.

Peeling cannot reach `p = 1/2`: both modulus curves vanish there, so there is no value for
it to single-cover. A kernel element supported at `1/2` alone is `c · δ_{1/2}`; its image
under `L` is `c · δ_0`, since both branches send `1/2` to the modulus value `0` and the
masses sum to one. Vanishing image therefore forces `c = 0` — and the step that forces it
is the mass identity `(L κ)([0,∞)) = κ(K)`, evaluated on the constant function `1`.

Formalized here in its arithmetic core: the total mass of the image of `c · δ_{1/2}` is
`c · (p + (1 - p)) = c`, so it vanishes exactly when `c` does. -/
