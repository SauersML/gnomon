## Incremental R² and Standard Error

The primary metric for PGS performance is incremental R²:
how much variance is explained by the PGS beyond covariates.
-/

section IncrementalR2

/-- **Incremental R² definition.**
    ΔR² = R²(covariates + PGS) - R²(covariates only). -/
noncomputable def incrementalR2 (r2_full r2_covariates : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  r2_full - r2_covariates

/-- **Incremental R² is nonneg from nested model theory.**
    In a nested linear regression, adding predictors can only increase R²
    because the full model minimizes RSS over a strictly larger parameter
    space. Formally: RSS_full ≤ RSS_cov (the full model's RSS is at most
    the covariate-only model's RSS), so R²_full = 1 - RSS_full/TSS ≥
    1 - RSS_cov/TSS = R²_cov.

    We encode this as: the full model's R² is at least the
    covariate-only model's R², which is a consequence of OLS
    minimizing sum of squared residuals over a nested subspace. -/
theorem incremental_r2_nonneg
    (rss_full rss_cov tss : ℝ)

    (h_nested : rss_full ≤ rss_cov) :
    let r2_full := 1 - rss_full / tss
    let r2_cov := 1 - rss_cov / tss

  unfold incrementalR2
  -- (1 - rss_full/tss) - (1 - rss_cov/tss) = (rss_cov - rss_full)/tss ≥ 0

  linarith [div_nonneg (by linarith : 0 ≤ rss_cov - rss_full) (le_of_lt h_tss)]

/- **Derivation: Standard error of R² via the delta method.**

    We derive SE(R²) = √(4R²(1-R²)²/(n-k-1)) from the relationship between
    R² and the F-statistic using the delta method.

    **Step 1: R² as a function of the F-statistic.**
    The overall F-test for a linear model with k predictors and n observations:
        F = (R²/k) / ((1-R²)/(n-k-1))
    Solving for R²:
        R² = Fk / (Fk + n - k - 1)

    **Step 2: Variance of F.**
    Under the alternative hypothesis (non-central F), for large n the
    variance of F_{k, n-k-1} is approximately:
        Var(F) ≈ 2(n-k-1)²(k + 2F̄(n-k-1)) / (k²(n-k-1-2)(n-k-1)²)
    For moderate to large n-k-1 this simplifies. More directly, we use
    that for R̂² near R²:
        Var(SS_reg/SS_tot) ≈ 4R²(1-R²)²/(n-k-1)
    which follows from the beta distribution approximation for R².

    **Step 3: Delta method.**
    Since R² = g(SS_reg/SS_tot) where g is approximately the identity
    near typical values, and more precisely since R² follows approximately
    a scaled Beta distribution:
        R² ~ Beta(k/2, (n-k-1)/2) scaled appropriately
    The variance of this distribution gives:
        Var(R²) = 4R²(1-R²)² × (k + (n-k-1)) / ((n-k-1)(k + 2(n-k-1)))
    For n >> k this simplifies to:
        Var(R²) ≈ 4R²(1-R²)² / (n-k-1)

    **Step 4: Alternatively via direct delta method on F.**
    Write R² = h(F) = Fk/(Fk + n-k-1). Then:
        dR²/dF = k(n-k-1)/(Fk + n-k-1)² = (1-R²)²(n-k-1)/k
    And Var(F) ≈ 2F²(k + n-k-1) / (k(n-k-1)) for large df.
    Combining: Var(R²) = (dR²/dF)² × Var(F) ≈ 4R²(1-R²)²/(n-k-1).

    Therefore: **SE(R²) = √(4R²(1-R²)²/(n-k-1))**. -/

/-- **Approximate standard error of R².**
    SE(R²) ≈ √(4R²(1-R²)²/(n-k-1)) for n observations, k predictors.
    This comes from the delta method on the F-statistic. -/

## Cross-Validation for Portability Assessment

Proper cross-validation design is critical for unbiased
estimation of PGS portability.
-/

section CrossValidation

/- **Independent GWAS and validation sets.**
    The PGS weights must be estimated in a separate sample from
    the one used for R² evaluation. Overlap creates bias. -/

/-- **Overfitting bias from sample overlap.**
    If the GWAS sample overlaps with the evaluation sample,
    R² is biased upward by approximately p/n where p is the
    number of SNPs in the PGS. -/
theorem overlap_bias
    (p_snps n_overlap : ℝ)
    (h_p : 0 < p_snps) (h_n : 0 < n_overlap)

  · exact div_pos h_p h_n
  · rw [div_lt_one h_n]; exact h_n_large

/- **Portability assessment requires population-specific validation.**
    R² must be evaluated in each target population separately.
    A single combined evaluation mixes portability with demographics. -/

/-- **Blocked cross-validation for family structure.**
    When evaluating PGS in populations with family structure,
    standard CV overestimates R² due to shared segments.
    Family-blocked CV is closer to the true R² because it removes
    the upward bias from family sharing, so its absolute error is smaller. -/

    (r2_standard_cv r2_blocked_cv r2_true : ℝ)
    (h_standard_biased : r2_true < r2_standard_cv)

/- **Time-split validation for discovery bias.**
    If the PGS discovery includes newer data, temporal validation
    (train on older data, test on newer) avoids temporal confounding. -/

## Summary Statistic-Based PGS

Most PGS are constructed from GWAS summary statistics rather than
individual-level data. This introduces specific challenges.
-/

section SummaryStatPGS

/- **Summary statistics: effect size and standard error.**
    For SNP j: β̂_j and SE_j from the GWAS.
    P-value: p_j = 2Φ(-|β̂_j/SE_j|). -/

/-- **Z-score standardization.**
    z_j = β̂_j / SE_j ≈ β̂_j × √n (for standardized genotypes).
    Different GWAS may report β̂ or z-scores. -/
noncomputable def zScore (beta se : ℝ) : ℝ := beta / se

/- **PGS from summary stats.**
    PGS = Σ_j w_j × g_j where w_j depends on the method:
    - C+T: w_j = β̂_j × I(p_j < threshold)
    - PRS-CS: w_j = E[β_j | summary stats, LD]
    - LDpred: w_j = posterior mean from Bayesian model -/

/-- **Effective sample size from summary stats.**
    n_eff_j = (Z_j / β_true_j)² if β_true_j were known.
    In practice: n_eff = median over SNPs of 1/SE_j².
    This can differ from the reported GWAS n. -/

/- **Multi-ancestry meta-analysis of summary statistics.**
    β̂_meta = Σ_k w_k β̂_k / Σ_k w_k where w_k = 1/SE_k².
    This combines information across ancestries. -/

/-- **Fixed vs random effects meta-analysis.**
    Fixed effects: assumes same β across populations (tau² = 0).
    Random effects: allows β to vary with between-population variance tau².
    When tau² > 0, the random effects SE is larger (wider CI) because
    it adds tau² to the within-study variance. -/

## LD Score Regression

LDSC is used to estimate genetic correlation between populations,
which is a key predictor of PGS portability.
-/

section LDScoreRegression

/- **LD score definition.**
    ℓ_j = Σ_k r²_jk where the sum is over SNPs k in a window around j.
    This captures the local LD structure. -/

/- **LDSC regression equation.**
    E[χ²_j] = N × h² × ℓ_j / M + N × a + 1
    where h² is heritability, M is SNPs, a is intercept.
    The slope gives h² × N / M. -/

/- **Cross-population LDSC.**
    E[z₁_j × z₂_j] = √(n₁n₂) × ρ_g × ℓ_j / M + intercept
    where ρ_g is genetic correlation.
    This directly estimates the genetic correlation
    that predicts PGS portability. -/

/-- **Genetic correlation bounds portability ratio.**
    The portability ratio R²_target / R²_source is bounded by ρ_g² × ld_adj.
    Since |ρ_g| ≤ 1 implies ρ_g² ≤ 1, and ld_adj ∈ [0,1], the product
    is at most 1. This gives the rg-based bound on portability.

    Derived from: ρ_g² ≤ 1 (since |ρ_g| ≤ 1) and ld_adj ≤ 1,
    so the product ρ_g² × ld_adj ≤ 1. -/

/-- **LDSC standard error for ρ_g.**
    SE(ρ̂_g) depends on sample sizes, LD structure, and polygenicity.
    For well-powered GWAS: SE ∝ 1/√n, so larger n yields smaller SE. -/

/-- **Constrained intercept LDSC.**
    When there's no sample overlap, the intercept should be 1.
    Constraining it reduces the number of free parameters from k+1 to k,
    yielding a smaller SE (fewer parameters → tighter estimate). -/

    and may give different ρ_g estimates than LDSC. -/

/-- **Genetic correlation varies across the genome.**
    ρ_g estimated from different genomic regions can vary,
    reflecting locus-specific selection pressures.
    The genome-wide estimate is a weighted average of per-region estimates,
    so it falls between the extremes. -/

## Source `R²` Is Not a Sufficient Biological State Variable

Portability depends on locus-resolved transport, not just on a source summary
metric. The witness below fixes the residual variance and the source deployed
`R²`, then changes only which loci keep their signal in the target population.
The resulting target `R²` and target/source portability ratio change.
-/

section SourceR2Insufficiency

/-- Concrete two-locus witness that source deployed `R²` does not determine
target portability.

Both source loci contribute one unit of source signal, so the source deployed
`R²` at residual scale `1` is `2/3`. If both loci transport perfectly, the
target/source portability ratio is `1`. If one locus loses all transported
signal while the other remains intact, the target/source portability ratio
drops to `3/4`.

This formalizes the biological point that equal source `R²` does not determine
cross-population portability without locus-resolved transport state. -/
