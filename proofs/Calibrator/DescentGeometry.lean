# The section map: descent for conditionals that are actually constructed

`Calibrator.FunctionalDescent` states descent for an abstract section map
`conditionalSection : Population → Context → Conditional`.  Nothing there builds a conditional
from a law, so its interaction and confounding witnesses are arithmetic identities that a reader
must accept as standing for descent statements.  This module supplies the missing construction —
`fiberConditional`, elementary division by a fiber mass — and then proves the descent statements
themselves.

The organizing object is the **section** over a label value `x`: the set of fiber conditionals
`{fiberConditional π (P i) x}` that the family of populations can realize there.  Descent says
exactly that the functional is constant on each section, and every result below is the geometry
of that set against the functional.

## What is proved

* `functionalDescends_iff_descendsAlong` — the abstract formulation is instantiated: for
  nonnegative laws, `FunctionalDescends` over `fiberConditional` is `DescendsAlong`.
* `descendsAlong_iff_pairwiseConsistent` — descent is decided by pairs of populations plus the
  exact witness-space inhabitation condition, for an arbitrary (not necessarily countable)
  family.  For ordinary inhabited value spaces there is no further finite-resolution gluing
  condition, which is exactly what fails for undominated families over a continuum.
* `kernelSufficient_iff_identity_descends` — every functional descends iff the family shares one
  fiber conditional, iff the identity functional descends.  One test settles the whole class.
* `descendsAlong_sectionMean_of_labelFunction` and `labelFunction_of_descends_pointLaws` — the
  affine pole: label-measurable kernels always descend, and against the family of all point laws
  nothing else does.
* `abs_sectionMean_sub_le` with `exists_kernel_attaining_totalVariationGap` — the size of the
  obstruction is the total-variation width of the section, attained, not a slack bound.
* `sectionMean_gap_unbounded_at_small_totalVariationGap` — and for kernels with no bound the
  width in total variation controls nothing at all: two laws at total-variation distance `2ε`
  can differ by any prescribed amount.  A bounded kernel is not a technical convenience in the
  bound above; without it the bound is false.
* `admissible_interaction_join_obstruction`, `admissible_confounding_meet_obstruction` — the two
  order-theoretic failures, stated over genuine probability-law families rather than as
  arithmetic.  The conditional risks driving them are `interactionRisk` and
  `confoundedConditionalRisk` from `Calibrator.FunctionalDescent`, so these are those witnesses,
  promoted without extending their parameters beyond the probability simplex.
* `kernelSufficient_componentPosterior` — the posterior component vector of a mixture is
  kernel-sufficient for the family of all mixing weights, so *every* functional descends along
  it.  This is `componentMixtureDensity_factorization` turned into a statement about
  conditionals.
* `exampleComponentResidual_eq_neg_one` — the ansatz that is *not* rescued by it.
  In an exact three-genome, two-component model the descended value at a genome is `-1` and the
  posterior-weighted average of the component values is `0`.

## Epistemic boundary

Everything is finite and exact.  Finiteness is what makes every family dominated, and domination
is exactly the hypothesis under which pairwise consistency is equivalent to descent; no statement
here covers undominated gluing over a continuum, and none should be read as evidence about it.
`fiberConditional` is canonical only where the fiber mass is nonzero, and every statement carries
that hypothesis.  No claim is made about measurable disintegration in a general Borel setting.

/-- **Descent along ancestry does not make the ancestry-weighted ansatz exact.**  In this model
the trait mean on the posterior fiber of the first genome is `-1`, while the posterior-weighted
average of the two component trait means at the same posterior is `0`: a
`componentRepresentationResidual` of `-1`, a full unit of trait, entirely localization and no
Jensen term, since the functional is affine.

Two shape intuitions both fail here.  The residual does not vanish at a balanced posterior — the
posterior at this genome is exactly balanced and the residual is maximal — and it is not a
small-overlap correction that a nonlinearity budget could absorb. -/
