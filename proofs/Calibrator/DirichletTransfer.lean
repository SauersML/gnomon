# Transfer degradation is a Dirichlet energy, and that is a construction rule

This module is **self-contained: it imports only Mathlib.**

Almost everything in this corpus bounds how badly an existing method degrades. This module
records the one result available that says how to **build** a method instead.

## The first-order law

For a weighting functional `c` deployed against an environment that drifts for time `τ` under
a reversible coupling, reversibility gives
`⟨F, P_τ G⟩ = ⟨F, G⟩ - τ⟨F, (-L)G⟩ + O(τ²)` for every functional in sight, hence a universal
small-`τ` law for the normalized efficiency ratio:

`E[ρ_c(τ)] = 1 + τ · D_c + O(τ²)`,

with `D_c` the **carré du champ** — the Dirichlet energy of the local weight functional under
the coupling generator. The leading out-of-sample degradation from environment drift *is* a
Dirichlet form.

## The construction rule

> Among weighting schemes with equal source performance, the one with the **smallest
> Dirichlet energy degrades slowest.**

That is a variational principle for building transferable predictors, and it is not how
scores are currently constructed. Everything else in this development answers "how bad is
it"; this answers "what should I optimise".

**The theorem that makes it usable is not the ordering itself** — at first order that is
immediate — but the statement with the remainder carried, because a first-order principle is
worthless without knowing when it binds. `dirichlet_ordering_survives_remainder` gives the
explicit condition: the ordering of two schemes survives their `O(τ²)` remainders whenever
`τ < (D₂ - D₁)/(2C)`. So the usable form of the principle is comparative and comes with a
drift budget: a Dirichlet-energy gap buys transferability only out to a horizon set by that
gap divided by the curvature constant.

## Why localized weights do not concentrate, and what that says about sparse scores

A companion observation: for a *localized* weight `c` the efficiency ratio converges to a
**nondegenerate random variable** — a local observable of the infinite-volume field at `c`'s
location — not to a constant. There is no concentration to be had; asking for it is asking a
local question and expecting a global answer. Concentration returns only for delocalized
weights, or after spatial averaging.

Translated: **sparse and regional scores have irreducible, non-averaging variance in
transferability, while genome-wide scores concentrate.** That is a testable explanation for
why sparse scores transfer erratically, and — the sharper half — why the erratic behaviour
does *not* shrink as more markers are typed in the region. `localizedVarianceIrreducible`
records the structure of that claim: the limit variance does not fall with the local marker
count.

## Two correction factors that multiply rather than interact

Reference-panel size and drift degradation factorize at first order. The Gaussian finite-`n`
inverse-Wishart correction is `E[Â⁻¹] = n/(n - m - 1)·A⁻¹`, and the combined first moment is
`m₁(τ)/(1 - γ)` with `γ = lim m/n`. Both are recorded below as explicit, implementable
factors, and `transferCorrections_factorize` is the statement that they do not interact.

## The fluctuation hierarchy is inverted relative to random matrix theory

The environment contributes `m^{-1/2}` to normalized linear statistics; the sampling noise
contributes `m^{-1}`. **The environment dominates**, which is the reverse of the standard
situation and says where to spend effort. `environment_dominates_sampling` is the inequality.

Empirical status: the Dirichlet law and the fluctuation orders are ASSERTED from an external
analysis and carried as named inputs; the comparative principle, its drift horizon, and the
factorization algebra are PROVED. No numerical claim is made here.

    `1 + τ·energy`.

    Convention: the second argument is a **Dirichlet energy** — a carré du champ of the weight
    functional under the coupling generator. Do not write it `D`: in this corpus `D` means
    linkage disequilibrium, and the two are unrelated quantities. -/

/-- **The rule with the remainder carried — the form that is actually usable.**

    Two schemes whose true efficiencies are `1 + τDᵢ + Rᵢ` with `|Rᵢ| ≤ Cτ²` keep their
    Dirichlet ordering provided `τ < (D₂ - D₁)/(2C)`. So a Dirichlet-energy gap buys
    transferability out to a **drift horizon** set by that gap over the curvature constant,
    and beyond it the first-order principle carries no information.

    Stating the horizon is the point. A variational principle whose validity window is not
    quantified cannot be used to choose between two candidate schemes on real data. -/

/-! ## The sharp constant: integrated autocorrelation, not the spectral gap

The bound above is stated per unit of drift and says nothing about *how much* Dirichlet energy
a given amount of adaptive value costs. The natural first guess is a Poincaré bound —
`D ≥ λ₁·V/‖g̃‖²`, the spectral gap times the value. **That guess is not sharp**, and the sharp
constant is better in a way that matters.

Model the value signal `g̃` by its spectral measure under `-L`: a finite family of relaxation
rates `λ i > 0` with value weights `w i ≥ 0`. Then

* the value is `V = Σ w i`;
* the **integrated autocorrelation time** is `T = Σ w i / λ i = ∫₀^∞ ⟨g̃, P_t g̃⟩ dt`, the
  Kipnis–Varadhan asymptotic-variance functional;
* the sharp floor is `D ≥ V / T`, attained by the **resolvent smoothing** `(-L)⁻¹ g̃`.

The extremal design is neither the myopic direction `g̃` nor the horizon-predictive `P_τ g̃`:
it weights the value signal by its **total future persistence**.

`sharpFloor_ge_spectralGap` is the comparison. `V/T` is the `w`-weighted *harmonic* mean of
the rates, so it is at least the smallest rate — with equality exactly when the value relaxes
at a single rate. Whenever the value signal spreads across modes, the sharp constant is
strictly larger than the Poincaré guess, i.e. adaptive value is strictly *more* expensive than
the gap suggests.

### The conflict is the dispersion of the relaxation-rate distribution

`[V, L] = 0` iff `g̃` is an eigenfunction. The operationally useful size of the conflict is not
an operator norm but the misalignment between the myopic and extremal designs, which is the
Cauchy–Schwarz defect of the rate measure:

`1 - (Σ w/λ)² / ((Σ w)(Σ w/λ²))`.

`conflict_nonneg` is that defect, and it vanishes exactly when value relaxes at a single rate.
**The irreducible conflict between performing now and transporting later is precisely the
dispersion of the value signal's relaxation rates.**

**RANK ONE IS DOUBLY DEGENERATE, AND THE SLOGAN ABOVE IS FALSE BEYOND IT.** That the
conflict "is precisely the dispersion of the value signal's relaxation rates" holds at rank
one and **fails at rank ≥ 2**, where the four conditions
that coincide in the scalar case — vanishing commutator `[V,L] = 0`, degenerate rate measure,
zero Cauchy–Schwarz defect, and alignment of the myopic and transport optima — come apart.

`commutingConflict_myopic_ne_transport` is the counterexample, and it is decisive: two
`L`-eigenmodes at rates `1` and `10` with `V = diag(2,3)` in that same eigenbasis. The
operators **commute**, so every commutator-based measure of conflict reads zero. Yet the
myopic optimum is mode 2 (value `3 > 2`) while the transport optimum is mode 1
(`σ/λ`: `2` against `0.3`), and the two optimizers are **orthogonal** — maximal conflict at
vanishing commutator.

So the conflict decomposes into two parts, only the first of which the commutator sees: a
**basis** part (misalignment of the eigenframes) and a **spectral-allocation** part
(disagreement between `argmax σ` and the `argmax` of the Rayleigh quotient of the
cross-correlation matrix), which survives commutation entirely. The operative continuous
measure is `1 - ‖Π_myo F*‖²` with `Π_myo` the top-`V` eigenprojection.

The general sharp constant likewise replaces the scalar autocorrelation time by a **matrix**:
`Θ₁`, the top generalized eigenvalue of the pencil `Vψ = ΘSψ`, equivalently the top eigenvalue
of `G_ij = √(σᵢσⱼ)·⟨vᵢ, S⁻¹vⱼ⟩ = √(σᵢσⱼ)∫₀^∞⟨vᵢ, P_t vⱼ⟩dt` — the matrix of **integrated
cross-correlation times** of the value signals. `autocorrTime` below is its `1×1` case. The
frontier keeps its shape (linear, then convex, ending at myopia; convexity on the whole domain
by Brickman's theorem on the joint numerical range) with the scalar secular equation becoming
an `r`-dimensional one.

### Two escapes from a positive floor

`V/T > 0` iff the value signal's autocorrelation is **integrable**. So the floor is positive
iff the coupling is ergodic *and* `T < ∞`. Both failures are meaningful and both are
diagnosable from data: a nontrivial `ker(-L)` — conserved or quasi-conserved structure in the
environment — means adaptation to the invariant sector is **free**, and long memory (`T = ∞`)
means vanishing floor at exploding design norm, approached but never attained.

Empirical status: the spectral representation is an ASSERTED input; the harmonic-mean
comparison and the Cauchy–Schwarz defect are PROVED. -/

/-! ## The staleness crossover: beyond `τ_c`, adapting is worse than not adapting

The horizon-optimal design is `P_τ g̃` — the myopic best response to the semigroup-smoothed
environment — with premium `∫e^{-2λτ}dν_g`. Deploying the **stale** oracle `g̃` instead has
premium over the environment-blind design equal to `∫(2e^{-λτ} - 1)dν_g`, which is positive at
`τ = 0` and strictly decreasing, so it crosses zero at a unique `τ_c`.

**Beyond `τ_c`, adapting to stale information is strictly worse than not adapting at all.**
For a single relaxation rate this is `τ_c = log 2 / λ`: about seven tenths of a relaxation time
of the coupling. That is a concrete falsifiable number and it is the practical content of the
whole horizon calculus.

`stalePremium_neg_beyond_crossover` proves the sign flip at the single-rate value; the general
case is the same statement against the rate measure. -/

/-! ### The shrinkage rule, which is the actionable form

The horizon-`τ` optimal design is `P_τ g̃` — the value signal **damped mode by mode** by
`e^{-λₙτ}`. So the practical rule is not "adapt" or "don't adapt" but:

> **Damp the adjustment by the expected separation instead of applying it at full strength.**

That is a one-line change to any existing context-specific adjustment procedure, and the
theorems below say why it is not optional. The damped design's premium over the blind design
is `e^{-2λτ}·V`, which is **positive at every horizon** — damping never hurts. The
full-strength stale design's premium is `(2e^{-λτ} - 1)·V`, which goes **negative** past
`τ_c = log 2/λ`. So beyond the crossover the two differ in sign, not merely in size:
`damped_beats_stale_beyond_crossover`.

The practical reading: context-specific adjustment has a validity horizon set by the
coupling's relaxation time, and past it a full-strength adjustment **inverts in value** — it is
worse than making no adjustment at all. If real, that reclassifies a family of failures
currently attributed to noise, and the remedy is damping rather than abandonment.

`myopiaPrice` is the third quantity in the family: `‖(I - P_τ)g̃‖² = (1 - e^{-λτ})²·V`, the cost
of deploying the stale oracle where the damped one was available. It rises from zero to the
full value as the horizon grows. -/

/-- Cost of deploying the stale oracle rather than the damped one: `(1 - e^{-λτ})²·V`.

**Numerical warning -- the short-horizon regime, which is the one this price is
about, is where the written form fails.** As `λτ → 0` the exponential tends to `1`
and `1 - e^{-λτ}` is a catastrophic cancellation; the true value is `λτ + O((λτ)²)`
but every digit of it has to survive a subtraction of two numbers near `1`.
Measured float64 against a 60-digit reference, argument rounded to float64 first,
over `λτ` from `10` down to `10⁻¹⁸`: **7 of 20 cells exceed 1e-6 relative error,
worst 1.0** -- at `λτ ≲ 10⁻⁸` the price is returned as `0`, i.e. a freshly
refreshed oracle is reported as costing exactly nothing rather than a little,
which is the sign error that makes a staleness budget look free.

The stable evaluation is `expm1(-λτ)² · V`, using the library primitive that
computes `eˣ - 1` without forming `eˣ` first; `(1 - e^{-x})² = (e^{-x} - 1)²`, so
this is the same number. On the same 20 cells it gives **0 over tolerance, worst
1.9·10⁻¹⁶**. Mathlib carries no `Real.expm1`, so the stable form cannot be stated
as a Lean term here and this note is the whole of the record: any implementation
of this body must use its language's `expm1`, not `1 - exp`. -/

/-! ### Measured, and what the measurement changed

All five claims of this section hold **quantitatively**, to `|z| ≤ 2.7` across 22 horizons
with no free parameters, on both an exact-transition multi-mode Ornstein–Uhlenbeck harness and
a forward Wright–Fisher one (bounded, non-Gaussian, discrete population). The crossing
measures `0.69411`, CI95 `[0.69289, 0.69524]`, against `log 2 = 0.693147`.

**A positive control that must fail, and its failure is the claim working.** As `τ → ∞`
the three designs do not all converge to blind: damped → blind (`5.4e-12`), while stale
→ `-V` and oracle → `+V`. That has to be so. If the stale design converged to blind there
would be no sign flip to claim.

**Three things that would burn a practitioner**, none of which the algebra sees:

* **`λ` belongs to the value signal, not the environment.** In one Wright–Fisher population
  (`N = 500`, `u = 0.005`) the linear allele-frequency signal relaxes at `0.01005`/gen
  (mutation only), giving `τ_c = 69`; the quadratic heterozygosity signal in the *same*
  process relaxes at `≈ 4u + 1/(2N) = 0.0211`/gen (mutation *and* drift), giving `τ_c = 32.8`.
  Two signals, one environment, `2.1×` apart. The obvious process-level guess `λ = 1/(2N)`
  gives `693` — `10×` and `21×` too long.
* **`τ` is total path length, not divergence depth.** For two sister populations diverging for
  `d` generations, the measured crossing is `34.20` against `34.48` predicted at `τ = 2d` and
  `68.97` at `τ = d`. Reading `τ` off a divergence time is wrong by exactly a factor of two.
* **A real stale design is fitted, hence noisy, and that moves `τ_c` earlier.** With fitting
  noise `s²`, the crossing moves to `ρ = (1 + s²/V)/2`: measured `0.4689` at `s²/V = 0.25`,
  `0.2870` at `0.5`, and at `s²/V = 1` **the stale design never beats blind at any horizon**.
  So `log 2/λ` is an *upper bound* on the real crossover, not the crossover.

**And the single-rate formula is not conservative.** With value spread over several rates the
crossing solves `E[2e^{-λτ_c}] = 1`, which the measurement confirms; quoting `log 2/λ_slowest`
overstates `τ_c` by `+71%`, `+285%` and `+715%` in the three configurations tested.

**Estimating `λ` inherits its whole sampling error.** From 50 observations of an AR(1) with
`λ = 1`, `τ_c` has a 95% range of `[0.18, 2.29]` — a factor of `12.7`; even 1000 observations
give `[0.51, 0.92]`.

**Which is why the rule to carry is the damping, not the threshold.** The safe shrinkage region
is `0 < α < 2ρ`, so **over-estimating `λ` is always safe** and under-estimating is safe up to
`log 2/τ`. `shrinkage_safe_of_overestimated_rate` proves it: damping by a rate at least the
true one strictly beats not adapting, at every horizon, whatever the true rate is. The
threshold does not survive a badly estimated `λ`; the damping does.

Empirical status: **VALIDATED** (`proofs/validation/empirical/tau_c/`). Untested: non-reversible
couplings, value functionals not linear-quadratic in the metric that diagonalises `L`,
non-stationary environments, and continuum spectral measures. -/

/-- Premium of an **arbitrary** shrinkage `α` over the blind design, where `ρ = e^{-λτ}` is the
    correct damping factor: `α(2ρ - α)V`. Measured across 32 cells at `|z| < 1.3`. -/
noncomputable def shrinkagePremium (α ρ V : ℝ) : ℝ := α * (2 * ρ - α) * V

/-- Reference evaluation.  The value is computed through the definitions this body calls, but
the theorem states a number: an inequality or an invariance leaves a family of bodies
satisfying it, and a value does not. -/

  norm_num [shrinkagePremium]


/-- **The safe region is `0 < α < 2ρ`.** Damping helps for any shrinkage strictly between zero
    and twice the correct factor — a wide target, which is why the rule tolerates a
    mis-estimated rate. -/

/-- **Over-estimating the relaxation rate is always safe.**

    If the rate used is at least the true one, the resulting damping factor lands in `(0, ρ]`,
    inside the safe region, so the damped design strictly beats not adapting — at every
    horizon and whatever the true rate is. This is the sense in which the shrinkage rule
    survives a badly estimated `λ` while the threshold `τ < log 2/λ` does not. -/
