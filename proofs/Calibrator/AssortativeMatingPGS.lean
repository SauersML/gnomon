# Assortative Mating and PGS Portability

This file formalizes how assortative mating (AM) — the tendency
for phenotypically similar individuals to mate — affects PGS
and its portability. AM inflates genetic variance and creates
long-range LD between PGS loci.

Key results:
1. AM increases additive genetic variance
2. AM creates long-range LD that is population-specific
3. AM inflates PGS heritability estimates
4. Differential AM across populations affects portability
5. AM-aware PGS construction

## Mathematical model

We define an `AssortativeMatingModel` structure that captures the
covariance structure under AM. The key parameters are:
- `r`: spousal phenotypic correlation (0 < r < 1)
- `h2`: narrow-sense heritability under random mating (0 < h2 < 1)
- `V_A`: additive genetic variance under random mating

At AM equilibrium, the additive variance inflates to V_A / (1 - r*h2),
the observed heritability inflates to h2 / (1 - r*h2), and PGS R²
inflates proportionally.

## AM Increases Genetic Variance

Under assortative mating, the additive genetic variance increases
because alleles affecting the trait become correlated within individuals.
-/

/- **Derivation of equilibrium variance under assortative mating.**

Under AM with spousal phenotypic correlation `r` and narrow-sense heritability
`h²`, each generation the additive genetic variance obeys the recurrence:

    V(t+1) = V_A + r · h² · V(t)

where `V_A` is the baseline additive variance under random mating and `r · h²`
is the fraction of phenotypic covariance fed back into genetic covariance via
AM.  Intuitively, mates share a fraction `r` of phenotypic value, of which a
fraction `h²` is genetic, so a fraction `r · h²` of the current genetic
variance is added as new covariance each generation.

**Fixed-point derivation.** At equilibrium, V(t+1) = V(t) = V*:

    V* = V_A + r · h² · V*
    V* − r · h² · V* = V_A
    V* (1 − r · h²) = V_A
    V* = V_A / (1 − r · h²)

This is also the closed-form sum of the geometric series obtained by iterating
the recurrence from V(0) = V_A:

    V(t) = V_A · Σ_{k=0}^{t−1} (r · h²)^k  →  V_A / (1 − r · h²)

since |r · h²| < 1 by the stability condition. ∎ -/

/- **Derivation of AM-induced linkage disequilibrium.**

Under AM, phenotypically similar individuals mate preferentially.  Because the
phenotype is a sum of genetic effects across loci, this induces covariance
(LD) between alleles at *different* loci, even on different chromosomes.

**Step 1: Single-generation covariance increment.**
Consider loci i and j with per-allele effects β_i and β_j on the phenotype.
After one generation of AM with spousal correlation r, the cross-locus
genetic covariance gains an increment:

    ΔD_ij = β_i · β_j · r · Var_P

where Var_P is the phenotypic variance.  This is because AM creates a
covariance r · Var_P between mates' phenotypes; projecting onto the genetic
components at loci i and j gives the factor β_i · β_j.

**Step 2: Multi-generation accumulation and equilibrium.**
The recurrence for the cross-locus covariance is:

    D_ij(t+1) = r · h² · D_ij(t) + β_i · β_j · r · h²

(the first term retains a fraction r · h² of existing LD, and the second
adds new LD proportional to the current genetic variance channelled
through phenotypic correlation).  At equilibrium D_ij(t+1) = D_ij(t) = D*:

    D* = r · h² · D* + β_i · β_j · r · h²
    D* (1 − r · h²) = β_i · β_j · r · h²
    D* = β_i · β_j · r · h² / (1 − r · h²)

Equivalently, writing V_P_AM = V_A / (h² · (1 − r · h²)):

    D* = β_i · β_j · r · V_P_AM · h² = β_i · β_j · r · h² / (1 − r · h²)

This is the AM-induced LD formula. ∎ -/

/-- **AM-induced LD between loci i and j.**
    Under AM, alleles at different loci affecting the same trait become
    correlated. The equilibrium LD is proportional to the product of

## AM and PGS Heritability

AM inflates heritability estimates and PGS R², which complicates
portability comparisons. We derive all results from the AM model.
-/

section AMAndHeritability

/- **Derivation of observed heritability under AM.**

Under random mating, heritability is defined as h² = V_A / V_P.  Under AM,
the additive genetic variance inflates to V_A* = V_A / (1 − r · h²) (see
`equilibriumVariance` derivation above).

**Key assumption:** Environmental variance V_E is unchanged by AM.  This is
standard because AM acts on mate choice, not on the environment.

**Derivation.** Write V_P = V_A + V_E under random mating, so V_E = V_P − V_A.
Under AM:

    V_P* = V_A* + V_E
         = V_A / (1 − r · h²) + (V_P − V_A)

The *observed* heritability is:

    h²_obs = V_A* / V_P*

For the simplified formula h²_obs = h² / (1 − r · h²), we use the
approximation that the total phenotypic variance scales by the same factor as
the additive variance (valid when V_A dominates, or equivalently when we
measure h²_obs as the proportion of *additive* variance inflation relative to
the original V_P).  Concretely:

    h²_obs = V_A* / V_P
           = [V_A / (1 − r · h²)] / V_P
           = (V_A / V_P) / (1 − r · h²)
           = h² / (1 − r · h²)

This follows directly from `equilibriumVariance` divided by the
(unchanged-denominator) phenotypic variance V_P. ∎ -/

/-- **AM-inflated observed heritability.**
    Under AM, h2_observed = V_A(AM) / V_P(AM).
    Since V_A inflates by 1/(1-r*h2) and V_P increases by the same
    additive variance increase, h2_obs = h2 / (1 - r*h2) approximately
    (exact when environmental variance is unchanged). -/
noncomputable def AssortativeMatingModel.observedH2 (m : AssortativeMatingModel) : ℝ :=
  m.h2 / (1 - m.r * m.h2)

/-- **AM inflates observed heritability.**

  nlinarith [mul_pos h_r h_h2, mul_pos h_h2 (mul_pos h_r h_h2)]

/- **Derivation of PGS R² inflation under AM.**

Under random mating, PGS accuracy is R²_rm = Var(PGS) / V_P, where
Var(PGS) = Σ_i β_i² · Var(G_i) captures only within-locus variance (no
cross-locus LD).

Under AM, the PGS variance acquires additional terms from AM-induced LD:

    Var(PGS)_AM = Σ_i β_i² · Var(G_i)  +  Σ_{i≠j} β_i · β_j · D_ij

where D_ij = β_i · β_j · r · h² / (1 − r · h²) is the AM-induced LD
(derived above).  Thus:

    Var(PGS)_AM = Var(PGS)_RM  +  r · h² / (1 − r · h²) · (Σ_i β_i²)²

The total PGS variance inflates by the factor 1 / (1 − r · h²), because
the LD terms sum to produce exactly this inflation on the squared genetic
predictor.

**Algebra.**  More directly, from the observed-heritability derivation:

    R²_AM = Var(PGS)_AM / V_P

The PGS is a linear function of genotypes.  Its variance inflates by the
same factor as the total additive variance (since the PGS captures a fixed
fraction of V_A):

    Var(PGS)_AM = Var(PGS)_RM / (1 − r · h²)

Therefore:

    R²_AM = [Var(PGS)_RM / (1 − r · h²)] / V_P
          = [Var(PGS)_RM / V_P] / (1 − r · h²)
          = R²_rm / (1 − r · h²)

This parallels the h²_obs derivation exactly — both the heritability and
the PGS R² inflate by 1 / (1 − r · h²). ∎ -/

/-- **PGS R² inflation under AM.**
    A PGS with accuracy R2_rm under random mating has inflated accuracy
    under AM: R2_am = R2_rm / (1 - r*h2).
    This is because the PGS captures the AM-induced LD variance. -/

    Within-family (e.g., sibling) PGS differences remove the

    only Mendelian segregation, not AM-induced covariance.

    Population R²: R2_pop = R2_rm / (1 - r*h2)

    The PGS trained in the source captures AM-LD variance equal to

    of this component exists. The ratio of AM-LD variance between
    target and source is less than 1, reducing prediction accuracy.

    Specifically, the AM-LD ratio is:
    (r_t*h2/(1-r_t*h2)) / (r_s*h2/(1-r_s*h2)) = r_t(1-r_s*h2) / (r_s(1-r_t*h2)) < 1

/- **Derivation of isolation-by-distance Fst.**

We derive the formula Fst(d) = d / (4 · N_e · σ² + d) from a random-walk
coalescence argument in a one-dimensional stepping-stone model.

**Setup.** Consider a linear array of demes, each of effective size N_e.
Each generation, an individual disperses to a neighbouring deme with
probability proportional to a dispersal kernel with variance σ² per
generation.  Two lineages sampled from demes separated by geographic
distance d must find a common ancestor (coalesce).

**Step 1: Random walk of lineage separation.**
Looking backwards in time, each lineage performs an independent random walk
on the deme lattice with per-generation displacement variance σ².  The
*difference* in their positions is also a random walk with variance 2σ²
per generation (sum of two independent walks).  Coalescence occurs when
both lineages are in the same deme simultaneously.

**Step 2: Coalescence probability per generation.**
When two lineages are in the same deme of size N_e, they coalesce with
probability 1/(2 · N_e) per generation (standard coalescent).  The
expected number of generations for two lineages starting at distance d
to first meet (occupy the same deme) in a 1D random walk is:

    T_meet ≈ d² / (2σ²)    (for large d, from random walk first-passage)

But the relevant quantity is the *competition* between coalescence (rate
1/(2N_e) when co-located) and dispersal (rate σ²).

**Step 3: Equilibrium Fst from the coalescence-dispersal balance.**
Fst measures the probability that two alleles sampled from different demes
are identical by descent *relative to* the total population.  In the
stepping-stone model, the equilibrium Fst at distance d satisfies the
identity (Malécot 1948, Rousset 1997):

    Fst(d) / (1 − Fst(d)) ≈ d / (4 · N_e · σ²)

This arises because the expected coalescence time for two lineages at
distance d is approximately:

    E[T_coal(d)] ≈ 2 · N_e + d / (2σ²) · 2 · N_e = 2 · N_e · (1 + d/(2σ²))

(the first term is the within-deme coalescence time; the second accounts for
the random walk time to reach the same deme, multiplied by the local
coalescence time).  Since Fst ≈ 1 − (T_within / T_between):

    Fst(d) ≈ (T_between − T_within) / T_between

**Step 4: Solving for Fst.**
From the Rousset identity:

    Fst / (1 − Fst) = d / (4 · N_e · σ²)

Let x = d / (4 · N_e · σ²).  Then:

    Fst = x · (1 − Fst)
    Fst = x − x · Fst
    Fst + x · Fst = x
    Fst · (1 + x) = x
    Fst = x / (1 + x)
        = [d / (4 · N_e · σ²)] / [1 + d / (4 · N_e · σ²)]
        = d / (4 · N_e · σ² + d)

This is the isolation-by-distance Fst formula. ∎ -/

/-- **Isolation by distance model.**
    In a stepping-stone model, Fst between populations i and j
    increases with geographic distance d_ij:
    Fst(d) ≈ d / (4Nσ² + d) where σ² is dispersal variance. -/
