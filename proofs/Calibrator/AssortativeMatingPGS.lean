# Assortative Mating and PGS Portability

This file formalizes how assortative mating (AM) — the tendency
for phenotypically similar individuals to mate — affects PGS
and its portability. AM inflates genetic variance and creates
long-range LD between PGS loci.

Key results:
1. AM increases additive genetic variance
2. AM creates long-range LD that is population-specific
3. AM inflates PGS heritability estimates
4. Differential AM across populations affects portability
5. AM-aware PGS construction

## Mathematical model

We define an `AssortativeMatingModel` structure that captures the
covariance structure under AM. The key parameters are:
- `r`: spousal phenotypic correlation (0 < r < 1)
- `V_A`: additive genetic variance under random mating
- `V_P`: total phenotypic variance, with `V_A < V_P`

The heritability `h2` is not among them. It is `V_A / V_P`, so it is computed rather than
supplied, and `0 < h2 < 1` is a theorem rather than an assumption.

At AM equilibrium, the additive variance inflates to V_A / (1 - r*h2), and the
observed heritability and PGS R² inflate by the SMALLER factor
1 / (1 - r*h2*(1 - h2)) — smaller because they are ratios to the phenotypic
variance, which inflates along with its additive part. Reading the additive
inflation as the R² inflation is measurably wrong; see `pgsR2AM`.

Provenance: derived here, not imported. Wang et al. (2026), Nature Communications 17:942,
substantiates nothing below. It is an empirical study of the polygenic-score portability
gap and does not treat assortative mating. Sources for individual results, where they
exist, are cited at those results.

## AM Increases Genetic Variance

Under assortative mating, the additive genetic variance increases
because alleles affecting the trait become correlated within individuals.
-/

/-- **One generation of Fisher's assortative-mating variance recursion.**

`V` is the additive genetic variance in the current generation; the result is
the variance in the next one.  `V₀` is the random-mating (linkage-equilibrium)
additive variance and is a *parameter* of the process, not a state variable.
Two things happen, in this order:

1. *Mating.*  Mates are correlated `r` in phenotype, so their additive values
   are correlated through the two regressions of `A` on `P`:
   `Cov(A_m, A_f) = (V_A/V_P)² · r V_P = r h² V`.  The mid-parent additive
   value therefore has variance `¼(V + V + 2 r h² V) = ½ V (1 + r h²)`.
2. *Segregation.*  Mendelian segregation within a family contributes `½ V₀`.
   It is `V₀` and not `V`: assortative mating builds only *between*-locus
   gametic disequilibrium, while the within-family segregation variance is
   fixed by the allele frequencies, which assortative mating does not move.
   Using `½ V` here instead collapses the recursion to a purely geometric one
   whose only fixed point is `0` -- a qualitatively different model.

Composition convention: mating precedes segregation within a generation, and
the transmission coefficient `r * h2` is held at its random-mating value.
This is the standard Fisher (1918) linearisation; letting `h²` track the
inflating variance gives a different, slowly-converging recursion.

    Empirical status: UNTESTED. -/
noncomputable def amVarianceStep (V₀ r h2 V : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  (V * (1 + r * h2) + V₀) / 2

/-- **AM equilibrium additive variance.**
    At equilibrium: V_A(AM) = V_A(RM) / (1 - r*h2).

    This closed form is not stipulated: it is the fixed point of
    `amVarianceStep`, and `AssortativeMatingModel.equilibriumVariance_isFixedPoint`
    is the theorem that pins it. -/

at `r = 1`, `h2 = 1`. Complete assortative mating on a fully heritable trait is the singularity
of this formula: the equilibrium additive variance diverges, because each generation's mating
correlation feeds back undamped. Lean returns `0` there rather than the value the modelled
quantity takes, and no type error marks the point. Consumers must require `1 - r * h2 ≠ 0`. -/

    one per parent per locus; the oracle is the mean off-diagonal correlation
    the mating process generates, which owes nothing to this formula:

    mating rather than inherited from physical linkage.

## AM and PGS Heritability

AM inflates heritability estimates and PGS R², which complicates
portability comparisons. We derive all results from the AM model.
-/

section AMAndHeritability

/-- **The R² and heritability denominator under AM.**

The additive variance inflates by `1/(1 - r·h²)` (`equilibriumVariance`, the
fixed point of `amVarianceStep`) while the environmental variance is untouched,
so the TOTAL variance inflates too — by `1 + h²(I - 1)` with `I = 1/(1 - r·h²)`.
A ratio to the total variance therefore inflates by `I / (1 + h²(I - 1))`, which
is `1 / (1 - r·h²(1 - h²))`. The `(1 - h²)` factor is the whole content: it is
the share of the phenotypic variance that does NOT inflate.

Positivity is a theorem rather than a field because `r·h²(1 - h²) ≤ 1/4` for any
model in the class, so no stability hypothesis beyond the structure's own is
needed. -/
theorem AssortativeMatingModel.ratio_denom_pos (m : AssortativeMatingModel) :
    0 < 1 - m.r * m.h2 * (1 - m.h2) := by
  have h0 : 0 < m.h2 := m.h2_pos
  have h1 : m.h2 < 1 := m.h2_lt_one

  have hr0 : 0 < m.r := m.r_pos
  nlinarith [sq_nonneg (m.h2 - 1 / 2), mul_pos hr0 h0]

/-- **AM-inflated observed heritability.**
    Under AM, h2_observed = V_A(AM) / V_P(AM) = h2 / (1 - r*h2*(1 - h2)).

    **The denominator is not `1 - r*h2`.** That is the inflation factor of the
    NUMERATOR alone. With the environmental variance unchanged — which is
    Fisher's model, and what makes assortment a redistribution rather than a
    creation of variance — the phenotypic variance in the denominator inflates
    as well, and the two inflations partly cancel. Writing `h2 / (1 - r*h2)`
    here reports the numerator's inflation as if the denominator were fixed;
    at `r = 0.5, h2 = 0.8` it returns `1.05`, a heritability above one.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_am01.py`). The measured
    quantity is the realised squared score-phenotype correlation of the true
    breeding value, which IS the observed heritability, so the `frac = 1` cells
    of that battery measure this definition and `pgsR2AM` at once: worst 2.1
    sems over four cells spanning 0.540 to 0.869, against the previous body
    `h2 / (1 - r*h2)` rejected on the same cells at up to 275 sems and 54%.

/-- **AM inflates observed heritability.**
    The observed heritability under AM exceeds the true (RM) heritability.

/-- Standalone version: AM inflates observed h2.

The observed heritability is written out rather than carried as a free variable
pinned by a hypothesis `h2_observed = h2_true / (1 - r * h2_true * (1 - h2_true))`.
That hypothesis stated the inflation law this module itself defines
(`AssortativeMatingModel.observedH2`) and handed it to the theorem as a gift;
substituting it changes nothing about what is proved and removes the gift.

The denominator carries the `(1 - h2_true)` factor for the reason given at
`AssortativeMatingModel.ratio_denom_pos`: the phenotypic variance in the
denominator of a heritability inflates along with the additive variance in its
numerator. -/

/-- **PGS R² inflation under AM.**
    A PGS with accuracy R2_rm under random mating has inflated accuracy
    under AM: R2_am = R2_rm / (1 - r*h2*(1 - h2)).
    The score captures the AM-induced LD variance, so its covariance with the
    phenotype inflates by `1/(1 - r*h2)`; the phenotype's own variance inflates
    by `1 + h2*(1/(1 - r*h2) - 1)` at the same time, and R² is a ratio to THAT.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**, and the previous body — `R2_rm / (1 - r*h2)`,
    the numerator's inflation with the denominator held fixed — is FALSIFIED on
    the same cells (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_am01.py`).
    Fisher assortative mating with the environmental variance held fixed, 120
    unlinked loci, 8000 individuals, 12 generations of Gaussian-copula mate
    pairing on BREEDING VALUE at the transmission coefficient `r*h2` that
    `amVarianceStep` holds at its random-mating value — so what is on trial here
    is the R² step alone, over this module's own declared variance law. `r` and
    `h2` are REALISED, read on four replicates, while the oracle — the realised
    squared score-phenotype correlation in generation 12 — is measured on eight
    DISJOINT ones, so no input is estimated from the replicates it is tested
    against:

      r     h2   R2_rm   this body   old body   measured             sems: this/old

    The old body's 1.341 is a squared correlation above one, which no
    measurement was needed to reject. The inverted competitor
    `R2_rm * (1 - r*h2)` is rejected at 227 sems, and the last cell puts the
    score on half the causal loci so `R2_rm` (0.269) is far from `h2`. The
    positive control — at `r = 0` the realised R² must reproduce
    `V_A/(V_A + V_E)` from the realised allele frequencies — passes at 0.78
    sems.

    Under the LITERAL field reading instead — mates paired on phenotype at
    correlation `r`, so the transmission coefficient tracks the inflating
    heritability, which is the reading `amVarianceStep` disowns — the same run
    gives 0.5379 against a measured 0.5456 and 0.8737 against 0.8724, while the
    old body gives 0.5838 and 1.3269. The repair does not depend on which
    reading is taken; the defect did not either. -/

## Two-Population AM Comparison Model

When source and target populations have different AM rates,
portability comparisons are confounded by differential AM inflation.

free parameter a model could set only by assuming something false. -/

/-- **Measured portability ratio under differential AM.**
    If both populations have the same true R2_rm, the measured portability
    ratio is:
      port_measured = R2_target / R2_source
                    = (R2_rm/(1-r_t*h2)) / (R2_rm/(1-r_s*h2))
                    = (1 - r_s*h2) / (1 - r_t*h2)
    When r_s > r_t, this ratio is < 1, creating an *apparent* portability
    loss that is purely an AM artifact. -/
noncomputable def DifferentialAMModel.apparentPortability (d : DifferentialAMModel) : ℝ :=
  (1 - d.r_s * d.h2) / (1 - d.r_t * d.h2)

/-- **Differential AM creates artifactual portability loss.**
    When source has more AM than target (r_s > r_t), the apparent
    portability is less than 1 even though the true genetic architecture
    is identical. This is because the source R² is more inflated. -/
theorem DifferentialAMModel.differential_am_misleading (d : DifferentialAMModel) :
    d.apparentPortability < 1 := by
  unfold apparentPortability
  rw [div_lt_one d.denom_t_pos]
  have : 0 < (d.r_s - d.r_t) * d.h2 := mul_pos (by linarith [d.more_am_in_source]) d.h2_pos
  linarith

/-- **AM-corrected portability.**
    Correcting for differential AM:
    port_corrected = port_measured * (1 - r_target*h2) / (1 - r_source*h2).

    The correction factor is the *reciprocal* of the artifact.  Writing the
    inflation as `R2_obs = R2_rm / (1 - r*h2)` in each population,

      port_measured = R2_t_obs / R2_s_obs
                    = (R2_rm_t / R2_rm_s) * (1 - r_s*h2) / (1 - r_t*h2)

    so recovering `R2_rm_t / R2_rm_s` requires multiplying by
    `(1 - r_t*h2) / (1 - r_s*h2)`.  The source denominator is the divisor:
    it is the source inflation that has to be undone.

    This factor was inverted until an exact-rational check caught it.  With
    `r_s = 1/2`, `r_t = 0`, `h2 = 1/2` and identical architectures (true
    portability `1`), `apparentPortability` is `3/4`; the inverted factor
    returned `(3/4) * (3/4) = 9/16`, moving *away* from `1` instead of
    recovering it, while the form above returns `(3/4) * (4/3) = 1`. -/
noncomputable def amCorrectedPortability
    (port_measured r_source r_target h2 : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  port_measured * (1 - r_target * h2) / (1 - r_source * h2)

/-- **amCorrectedPortability where its denominator vanishes, named.** The guard `1 - r_source * h2`
is zero at `r_source = 1`, `h2 = 1`. At `r_source * h2 = 1` the source correction diverges, so a
portability estimate corrected for assortative mating collapses to zero exactly where the
correction matters most. Lean returns `0` there rather than the value the modelled quantity
takes, and no type error marks the point. Consumers must require `1 - r_source * h2 ≠ 0`. -/
theorem amCorrectedPortability_at_rsource1h21_is_junk (port_measured : ℝ) (r_target : ℝ) :
    amCorrectedPortability port_measured 1 r_target 1 = 0 := by
  unfold amCorrectedPortability
  norm_num

/-- **AM correction raises measured portability when source has more AM.**
    The source AM inflates source R² more than the target's, which deflates
    the measured ratio; undoing it multiplies by
    (1-r_t*h2)/(1-r_s*h2) > 1 when r_s > r_t.

    `h_stability_s : r_s * h2 < 1` is load-bearing and is the *source*
    condition, not the target one.  It is what makes the divisor positive.
    Dropping it in favour of `r_t * h2 < 1` makes the statement false:
    at `port_m = 1`, `h2 = 1`, `r_t = 0`, `r_s = 2` the target condition
    holds, the divisor is `1 - 2 = -1`, and the corrected value is `-1`,
    which is below `port_m` rather than above it.

    The target condition is *derivable* here (`r_t * h2 < r_s * h2 < 1`), so
    it is not restated.

    Which of the two is load-bearing depends on the direction of the
    correction: before `amCorrectedPortability` was inverted the divisor was
    `1 - r_t * h2` and the target condition was the necessary one.  An
    unused-premise scan that dropped the source condition was correct against
    that earlier statement and became wrong when the divisor moved.  Such a
    scan is only valid against the statement it was computed on. -/

    If the only source of portability loss is differential AM,
    then the corrected portability equals 1 (perfect portability).
    We show: if port_measured = (1-r_s*h2)/(1-r_t*h2) -- which is exactly
    `DifferentialAMModel.apparentPortability`, the AM artifact proved `< 1`
    by `differential_am_misleading` -- then amCorrectedPortability = 1.

    The input was previously written `(1-r_t*h2)/(1-r_s*h2)`, the reciprocal
    of this file's own `apparentPortability`, and so did not describe the
    artifact the section is about. -/

/-- **The correction inverts the artifact exactly.**  Feeding
`DifferentialAMModel.apparentPortability` -- the file's own model of the
measured ratio under identical architectures -- through the correction
returns `1`.  This ties the two definitions together, so a future edit that
inverts one without the other stops being provable. -/

/-- **AM-LD breaks cross-population prediction.**
    The PGS trained in the source captures AM-LD variance equal to
    R2_rm * r_s*h2/(1-r_s*h2). In the target, only r_t*h2/(1-r_t*h2)
    of this component exists. The ratio of AM-LD variance between
    target and source is less than 1, reducing prediction accuracy.

    Specifically, the AM-LD ratio is:
    (r_t*h2/(1-r_t*h2)) / (r_s*h2/(1-r_s*h2)) = r_t(1-r_s*h2) / (r_s(1-r_t*h2)) < 1
    when r_t < r_s.

    **What the cleared form shows, and it is less than the docstring above.**
    Expanding both sides, `r_t·(1 - r_s·h2) < r_s·(1 - r_t·h2)` is
    `r_t - r_s·r_t·h2 < r_s - r_s·r_t·h2`: the assortment term is the *same* on
    both sides and cancels, leaving `r_t < r_s`. The conclusion is therefore
    `h_more` written in a heavier notation, and `h2` does not enter at all. A
    scan of the kernel-accepted proof term confirmed it: the positivity and
    stability premises `h_rs`, `h_rt`, `h_h2`, `h_stab_s`, `h_stab_t` occur
    nowhere in the proof and have been removed. Read this as the cancellation
    identity it is, not as evidence that assortative mating degrades transfer;
    the substantive claim is upstream, in the *division* by
    `r_s·h2/(1 - r_s·h2)`, which this statement never performs. -/

## Population Structure and PGS

Population structure beyond simple two-population models
affects PGS in complex ways.
-/

section PopulationStructure

/-- **Isolation by distance model.**
    In a stepping-stone model, Fst between populations i and j
    increases with geographic distance d_ij:
    Fst(d) ≈ d / (4Nσ² + d) where σ² is dispersal variance.

    **Convention, and it is not the one the corpus's other stepping-stone body uses.**
    `N` here is a population *density* — individuals per unit of the same length in
    which `d` and `σ_sq` are measured — not a deme size. This is Rousset's continuous
    isolation-by-distance law `F / (1 - F) = d / (4·N·σ²)`, rearranged; the migration
    rate is absent because dispersal enters through `σ_sq` and abundance through the
    density, not through a per-generation `m`. Read `N` as a deme size instead and the
    body is a stepping-stone `F_ST` with the migration rate dropped, which is a
    different and wrong formula: contrast
    `Calibrator.DemographicHistory.demoSteppingStoneFst = d / (d + 4·Ne·m·σ_sq)`, whose
    `Ne` *is* a deme size and which therefore must and does carry `m`. Dimensional
    analysis is what separates the two readings — under the deme-size reading `4·N·σ_sq`
    carries a spurious factor of generations and cannot be added to `d` — and nothing in
    the body itself does, which is why the convention is stated here.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED under the density reading**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/popgensel/ibdcell.py`, cell H). The dimensional check
    above rules out the deme-size reading; this measurement is about the density reading it
    leaves standing.

    The body is equivalent to `F/(1-F) = d/(4·N·σ²)`, so what is measured is Rousset's
    regression statistic against distance on a RING of demes -- every deme equivalent, no
    edges -- under the stepping-stone reparametrisation that IS the density reading:
    `N` is the deme size per unit spacing and `σ² = 2m` for nearest-neighbour migration at
    rate `m` each way. The observable is Rousset's own
    `a_r = (π_between(d) - π_within)/π_within`, built from probabilities of identity and
    NOT from any named `F_ST` estimator, and the discrimination is its SLOPE in `d`. Both
    choices are deliberate: Nei's `G_ST` between two demes is a quarter of the corpus's
    pairwise `F_ST`, so a cell reporting a factor of four here would be reporting an
    estimator convention, and a slope is immune to an additive offset.

    | demes | `N` | `m` | `σ²` | fitted slope | this def `1/(4Nσ²)` | sems |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | 40 | 20 | 0.05 | 0.1 | 0.12459 ± 0.01037 | 0.12500 | 0.04 |
    | 100 | 40 | 0.10 | 0.2 | 0.02797 ± 0.00172 | 0.03125 | 1.90 |

    The competitors are rejected on both rows: `1/(2Nσ²)` at 12.1 and 20.1 sems and
    `1/(8Nσ²)` at 6.0 and 7.2 sems, so the constant `4` is pinned rather than tolerated,
    and the `PLANTED` arm at `1.4x` is rejected at 4.9 and 9.2 sems.

    The positive control is the fitted intercept, which Rousset's law requires to
    extrapolate to zero: `0.00023 ± 0.02036` and `-0.00332 ± 0.00500`.

    That control is also what diagnosed the one cell that did not pass. At 40 demes rather
    than 100, the second design read `0.02352 ± 0.00243` -- 25 percent low, 3.18 sems --
    with an intercept of `0.01219 ± 0.00753`, 1.6 sems from the zero it must have.
    Enlarging the ring at unchanged `N` and `m` moved the slope UP to `0.02797` and the
    intercept back to zero, which is what finite-habitat saturation predicts and what a
    genuine failure of the law would not have done: if the shortfall had been the body's, a
    larger habitat would not have repaired it. The higher-`Nσ²` design needs a habitat
    larger than the neighbourhood size, and at 40 demes it did not have one. -/
