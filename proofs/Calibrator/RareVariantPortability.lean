# Rare Variant Contributions to PGS and Portability

This file formalizes the role of rare variants (MAF < 1%) in
polygenic scores and their impact on cross-population portability.
Rare variants are mostly population-specific, creating unique
portability challenges.

Key results:
1. Rare variant population-specificity
2. Burden tests and gene-based PGS
3. Loss-of-function variant portability
4. Rare variant effect size distribution

## Rare Variant Population Specificity

Most rare variants are recent in origin and population-specific.
This has direct implications for PGS portability.
-/

section RareVariantSpecificity

/-- **Variant sharing decreases with MAF.**
    The probability that a variant is shared between two populations
    decreases with decreasing MAF. -/
noncomputable def variantSharingProb (fst maf : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  1 - (1 - maf) ^ (1 / fst)

/-- **Ultra-rare variants are almost never shared.**
    Under the coalescent, a variant at frequency p in one population
    has sharing probability ≈ 2·Ne·p in a diverged population (for
    recent divergence relative to 2·Ne generations).

    For ultra-rare variants where p < 1/(2·Ne), the sharing probability
    2·Ne·p is bounded below 1.  This is the defining feature of
    ultra-rare variants: they arose recently enough that they almost
    certainly have not spread to the sister population.

    Proof: multiply both sides of p < 1/(2·Ne) by the positive
    quantity 2·Ne. -/

/-- **Rare variant contribution to heritability.**
    Under the LDAK-thin model with negative selection (α < 0),
    E[β²] ∝ [p(1-p)]^(1+α). For rare variants (small p), the
    contribution to h² per variant is β²·2p(1-p) ∝ [p(1-p)]^α
    which is large when α < 0.

    Concretely: if there are n_rare rare variants each contributing
    average variance v_rare, and n_common common variants contributing
    v_common, then h²_rare = n_rare·v_rare. We show that when
    n_rare·v_rare > 0 and n_common·v_common > 0, the rare fraction
    h²_rare / h²_total is well-defined and h²_rare is a strictly
    positive component of h²_total. -/

/-- **Rare variant PGS has zero cross-population portability.**
    If a variant exists only in population A (MAF_B = 0),
    it contributes zero to PGS prediction in population B. -/

  rw [h_absent]; ring

/-- **Number of rare variants scales with population size.**
    n_rare ∝ θ × Σ_{i=1}^{2N} 1/i ≈ θ × ln(2N).
    Larger populations have more rare variants because θ = 4·Ne·μ
    scales linearly with Ne. For the same mutation rate μ, a larger
    population has proportionally more expected segregating sites. -/

## Burden Tests and Gene-Based PGS

Collapsing rare variants into gene-level scores improves power
and can improve portability.
-/

section BurdenTests

/- **Burden test aggregates rare variants per gene.**
    Gene-level score = Σ_i w_i × g_i for rare variants i in the gene.
    This improves power by reducing the multiple testing burden. -/

/-- **Gene-level scores are more portable than variant-level.**
    Even if specific rare variants differ, the gene-level burden
    may be similar across populations. If variant sharing rate is s < 1
    and there are k variants per gene with independent presence/absence,
    the probability that at least one variant is shared is 1-(1-s)^k > s
    for k ≥ 2. The gene-level signal is preserved whenever any variant
    in the gene is present. -/
theorem gene_level_more_portable
    (s : ℝ) (k : ℕ)
    (h_s_pos : 0 < s) (h_s_lt : s < 1)
    (h_k : 2 ≤ k) :
    s < 1 - (1 - s) ^ k := by

  have h_expand : (1 - s) ^ 2 = 1 - 2 * s + s ^ 2 := by ring
  nlinarith [sq_nonneg s]

/-- **Functional equivalence across populations aids portability.**
    If k variants in a gene have equivalent functional effects (each
    with effect size β), then the gene-level burden score has variance
    k·β² in each population. Even if the specific variants differ
    completely between populations, the burden scores are both drawn
    from distributions with the same mean and variance.

    We model this: pop A has k_A variants, pop B has k_B variants,
    all with effect β. The cross-population correlation of gene
    burden depends on √(k_A · k_B) / max(k_A, k_B), which increases
    when variants are functionally equivalent (because both k_A and
    k_B contribute to the same gene signal).

    Here we prove the core algebraic fact: the gene-level variance
    (k · β²) exceeds single-variant variance (β²) when k ≥ 2. -/
theorem functional_equivalence_aids_portability
    (β : ℝ) (k : ℕ)
    (h_β : β ≠ 0)

    exact_mod_cast (by omega : 1 < k)
  linarith [mul_lt_mul_of_pos_right h_k_real h_β2]

/-- **Optimal weighting of rare variants in burden test.**
    Common weights: constant (1), MAF-based (1/√(p(1-p))),
    functional (CADD, PolyPhen).
    Functional weights improve portability because they capture
    the biological effect regardless of frequency. -/

    (h_func_best : port_maf < port_functional)
    (h_const_worst : port_constant < port_maf) :
    port_constant < port_functional := by linarith

/-- **SKAT (sequence kernel association test) handles bidirectional effects.**
    Unlike burden tests, SKAT allows variants to have different
    directions of effect within a gene. When effects cancel in a burden
    test (positive and negative effects sum to ~0), the burden signal
    is lost. The variance-based SKAT statistic Σβᵢ² captures signal
    regardless of sign. -/
theorem skat_handles_bidirectional
    (β₁ β₂ : ℝ)
    (h_opposite : β₁ + β₂ = 0)
    (h_nonzero : β₁ ≠ 0) :

## WGS-Based PGS

Whole genome sequencing enables inclusion of rare variants in PGS,
but the portability implications are complex.

/-- **Common variant component ports better.**
    PGS_common has moderate portability (shared variants, LD issues).
    PGS_rare has very poor portability (population-specific variants).
    If common variants have sharing rate s_c and rare variants s_r < s_c,
    then for the same effect size β, the expected cross-population
    signal β²·2p(1-p)·s is larger for common variants. -/

/-- **WGS PGS within-population outperforms array PGS.**
    Within the discovery population, WGS PGS captures more variance
    (including rare variant contributions). The WGS R² = R²_common + R²_rare
    while array R² ≈ R²_common (arrays miss rare variants). -/

/-- **WGS PGS cross-population can be worse than array PGS.**
    Because population-specific rare variants add noise in the
    target population (zero signal + estimation error).
    If rare variant R² in target is 0 but rare variant estimation noise
    is ε > 0, the WGS PGS cross-population R² is reduced. -/

    Use common variants for the shared component (portable)

## Loss-of-Function Variants

Loss-of-function (LoF) variants have uniquely interpretable effects
and different portability properties.
-/

    LoF variants typically have effect sizes 5-10x larger than
    common regulatory variants, but they are very rare. -/

/-- **LoF variant portability depends on gene constraint.**
    Highly constrained genes have LoF variants in all populations
    (purifying selection maintains them rare). Under purifying selection
    with coefficient s, the equilibrium frequency is μ/s
    (mutation-selection balance). For strong selection (large s),
    variants are rarer but consistently present across populations.
    The proportion of genetic variance maintained across populations
    increases with selection strength.

    Worked example: Genes with high constraint (e.g., pLI > 0.9) show
    this pattern most clearly. -/

    even if the specific variants differ. -/

/-- **Negative selection constrains common variant effects.**
    E[|β|² | MAF] decreases with MAF because purifying selection
    removes large-effect alleles that reach high frequency.
    Under the LDAK model, β² ∝ [p(1-p)]^(1+α) with α < 0,
    so expected β² ∝ 1/[p(1-p)]^|α|. For rare variants (smaller p(1-p)),
    the expected effect size is larger. -/

    When `α < -1`, the exponent `1 + α` is negative, so lower heterozygosity
    implies a larger expected effect-size multiplier. This makes rarer variants
