# Rare Variant Contributions to PGS and Portability

This file formalizes the role of rare variants (MAF < 1%) in
polygenic scores and their impact on cross-population portability.
Rare variants are mostly population-specific, creating unique
portability challenges.

Key results:
1. Rare variant population-specificity
2. Burden tests and gene-based PGS
3. Loss-of-function variant portability
4. Rare variant effect size distribution

Provenance: derived here, not imported. Wang et al. (2026), Nature Communications 17:942,
substantiates nothing below. It is an empirical study of the polygenic-score portability
gap and does not treat rare-variant sharing, burden tests or loss-of-function variants.
Sources for individual results, where they exist, are cited at those results.

## Rare Variant Population Specificity

Most rare variants are recent in origin and population-specific.
This has direct implications for PGS portability.

    Read as genetics the two summands are rare and common contributions to
    heritability, so the rare share is neither nothing nor everything. The
    LDAK-thin scaling `E[β²] ∝ [p(1-p)]^(1+α)` that would make the rare
    contribution *substantial* rather than merely positive appears nowhere: no
    `α`, no frequency and no effect size occurs below, and "substantial" is not
    a formal claim about a quantity bounded only by `0` and `1`. -/

## Burden Tests and Gene-Based PGS

Collapsing rare variants into gene-level scores improves power
and can improve portability.
-/

section BurdenTests

/-- Probability that at least one of `variantCount` independently shared variants survives in a
gene-level burden, given per-variant sharing probability `singleShare`. -/
noncomputable def independentGeneSharingProbability
    (singleShare : ℝ) (variantCount : ℕ) : ℝ :=

/-- **At least one of `k` shares beats one share**, for `k ≥ 2`:
    `s < 1 - (1-s)^k` whenever `0 < s < 1`.

    The motivating reading is that if each of `k` variants in a gene is shared
    across populations independently with rate `s`, a gene-level burden survives
    when any one of them is shared. That reading is prose: no gene, no burden,
    no population and no independence assumption appears below. The statement is
    the inequality on two reals and a natural, and `nlinarith` proves it. Whether
    the sharing events are independent — the assumption that makes
    `1 - (1-s)^k` the right probability — is exactly what a portability claim
    would have to establish, and it is assumed away by writing the expression. -/

noncomputable def homogeneousGeneBurdenVariance (β : ℝ) (variantCount : ℕ) : ℝ :=

/-- **A nontrivial homogeneous gene burden has more variance than one variant.**

    Read as genetics: if `k` variants in a gene carry the same effect `β` and
    contribute additively, gene-level burden variance `k·β²` exceeds
    single-variant variance `β²`. Nothing below carries that reading. There is
    no gene, no burden, and no second population — in particular no
    cross-population correlation, which is what a portability claim would need.
    What is proved is that multiplying a positive number by something larger
    than one increases it. -/

    This is the two-variant shape of the reason a variance statistic sees signal
    a burden statistic cancels away. It is not a theorem about SKAT: no kernel,
    no test statistic, no null distribution and no power comparison appears
    below, and nothing here says the variance statistic *detects* anything. Two
    reals summing to zero, one of them nonzero. -/

### Mutation-selection balance, as the fixed point of a map

The frequency of a deleterious allele under purifying selection is usually quoted
as `μ/s`. That number is not a frequency: for `s < μ` it exceeds `1`, and `s < μ`
is admissible for exactly the weakly-constrained comparison arm the portability
claim is about. It is also the wrong quantity twice over — the dominant balance
is `μ/(h s)` and the recessive one is `√(μ/s)` — and this file's subject matter,
LoF variants scored by pLI and haploinsufficiency, spans both regimes.

So the two regimes are written here as one-generation maps and their equilibria
are derived as fixed points of those maps, in the shape of
`Calibrator.PopulationGeneticsFoundations.selectionMigrationEquilibrium_isFixedPoint`.
Both equilibria land in `[0, 1]` by construction rather than by hypothesis.
-/

/-- **One generation of mutation-selection dynamics for a rare deleterious allele
with dominance coefficient `h`.**

Heterozygotes carry selective load `h * s` and are the only carriers that matter
while the allele is rare, so the selection step multiplies the frequency by
`1 - h * s`; mutation then converts a fraction `mu` of the wild-type allele.
The `p ^ 2` homozygote term is dropped, which is the rare-allele linearization
and is valid only while `h * s` dominates `mu` — see
`mutationSelectionBalance_at_zero_dominance`, which shows the map degenerates at
`h = 0` and hands the recessive case to `mutationSelectionStepRecessive`.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED as a linearisation**, with the gap
    stated (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk2.py`,
    `test_selection_step_against_wf`). Against one generation of EXACT viability
    selection -- genotype fitnesses `1`, `1 - h s`, `1 - s`, renormalised by mean
    fitness -- then two-way mutation, from `p = 0.2`:

      h     s      mu        this def   exact selection   relative
      0.5   0.02   1e-04      0.19808   0.19845            -0.19%
      0.5   0.10   1e-04      0.19008   0.19190            -0.95%
      0.2   0.05   1e-03      0.19880   0.19803            +0.39%

    The step drops the mean-fitness denominator and the `p²` term, so it is a
    linearisation valid at small `s` and small `p`; at `s = 0.1`, `p = 0.2` it is
    already about one percent per generation, which compounds over a run. Both
    sides are deterministic, so this is exact arithmetic and the gap is the
    approximation rather than sampling noise. -/

  p * (1 - h * s) + mu * (1 - p)

/-- **mutationSelectionStepRare pinned at a reference point.** No theorem in the corpus evaluated
this definition, so every body agreeing with it in sign and monotonicity was indistinguishable
from it. At all arguments equal to `1 / 2` it is `5 / 8`, which fixes the coefficients a
one-sided bound or an invariance leaves free. -/

/-- **Mutation-selection balance for a partially dominant deleterious allele.**

The fixed point of `mutationSelectionStepRare`. It is `mu / (h * s + mu)`, not
`mu / (h * s)`: the two agree to leading order when `h * s` is large against
`mu`, and the difference is what keeps this quantity inside `[0, 1]` for every
admissible parameter, including the weak-constraint regime `s < mu` where
`mu / s` is not a frequency at all.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk2.py`,
    `test_mutation_selection`). It is the fixed point of
    `mutationSelectionStepRare`, and iterating that recursion to convergence from
    `p = 0.5` -- three hundred times the equilibrium -- reproduces it to every
    digit carried, at `mu` from 1e-05 to 1e-04 and `h*s` from 0.005 to 0.05.

noncomputable def mutationSelectionBalance (mu s h : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  mu / (h * s + mu)

/-- **Without selection nothing holds the allele down.**

At `h * s = 0` the balance is one: mutation pushes and nothing pushes back, so the allele fixes.
The identification with the drift chart's saturation map, recorded below, is a cross-identity
between two definitions and constrains them jointly; both could carry the same wrong coefficient
on `h * s` and it would survive. This endpoint does not, and it is what makes the denominator a
sum of the two opposing rates rather than a fitted normalisation. -/

/-- **Mutation-selection balance is the drift chart's saturation map, at a
different argument.**

`fstFromTau` sends `tau` to `tau / (1 + tau)`, and the balance frequency is that
same map applied to the ratio of mutation to effective selection, `mu / (h s)`.
The two modules therefore share one rational function: whatever is true of the
saturation law at one is true at the other, and a change to either body that
breaks this identity fails to compile rather than leaving the two quietly
disagreeing about a shape they both claim. -/

`DGP.fstMutationDriftEquilibrium θ = 1 / (1 + θ)` is this corpus's one body for the fraction

mutation-selection balance is that map at `θ = h·s / mu` — the selective load measured in
units of the mutation rate, exactly as `θ` and `M` measure mutation and migration in units
of drift.

Reading it this way is what makes the `mu / (h·s + mu)` form forced rather than chosen. The
textbook `mu / (h·s)` is not `1 / (1 + θ)` at any `θ`, and it leaves the unit interval in the
weak-constraint regime; the identity below is what a substitution of the one for the other
would have to contradict. -/

    Highly constrained genes have LoF variants in all populations
    (purifying selection maintains them rare). The comparison is made on the
    dominant mutation-selection balance derived above, at a common dominance
    coefficient `h`, so both arms are frequencies in `[0, 1]` whatever the
    selection coefficients are — including the weakly constrained arm with
    `s < mu`, where `mu / s` exceeds one and is therefore not a frequency at all.

    Worked example: Genes with high constraint (e.g., pLI > 0.9) show
    this pattern most clearly, and `haploinsufficiency_consistent_direction`
    below is about the same `h > 0` regime this theorem is stated in. -/

/-! **Deleted: `gene_lof_maximally_portable_rare`.**

This declaration is absent on purpose. It took `a ≤ b` and `b ≤ c` and returned
`le_trans h₁ h₂`: transitivity of `≤` on three reals, which is Mathlib's
`le_trans`, under a name asserting that gene-level loss-of-function aggregation
is the most portable rare-variant construction. Nothing in it referred to a
gene, a variant, an annotation or a score, and "maximally portable" is not a
statement two applications of `≤` can carry — a maximum needs a set to be
maximal over, and none was given. -/

## Rare Variant Effect Size Distribution

The effect size distribution of rare variants differs from common
variants, affecting both PGS construction and portability.
-/

section EffectSizeDistribution

/-- **`2p(1-p)` is strictly increasing below `1/2`.**

    The selection reading — purifying selection removing large-effect alleles
    that reach high frequency, so `E[β²|MAF]` falls with `MAF` — is about effect
    sizes, and no effect size appears below. This is the heterozygosity
    expression alone, monotone on the left half of the frequency range. -/
theorem two_mul_mul_one_sub_lt_of_lt
    (maf_rare maf_common : ℝ)
    (h_common_lt : maf_common ≤ 1/2)
    (h_rare_maf : maf_rare < maf_common) :
    -- Heterozygosity is smaller for rarer variants (when both ≤ 1/2)
    2 * maf_rare * (1 - maf_rare) < 2 * maf_common * (1 - maf_common) :=
  two_mul_one_sub_strictMono_le_half maf_rare maf_common h_rare_maf h_common_lt

/-- **The α model: E[β²] ∝ [p(1-p)]^(1+α).**
    α = 0: neutral (no relationship between MAF and effect)
    α = -1: LDAK (β² ∝ 1/[p(1-p)])
    When `α < -1`, the exponent `1 + α` is negative, so lower heterozygosity
    implies a larger expected effect-size multiplier. This makes rarer variants
    more population-specific and therefore less portable.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_ldsc.py`,
    `test_expected_effect_multiplier`). Under the alpha model each locus
    contributes `2 p(1-p) beta^2` to genetic variance with `Var(beta)`
    proportional to `(p(1-p))^alpha`, so the contribution scales as
    `(p(1-p))^(1+alpha)`. Measured as the RATIO of mean contribution between a
    `p ≈ 0.5` band and a `p ≈ 0.1` band, which is a derived consequence of the
    construction rather than the construction itself:

      alpha    this def   simulated            sems
      -1.0      1.00000   0.99874±0.01451      0.09
      -0.5      1.66667   1.64558±0.02389      0.88
       0.0      2.77778   2.79000±0.04033      0.30

    The `alpha = -1` cell is the one that matters: it predicts NO frequency
    dependence of the variance contribution, and the measurement returns 0.999.

    Power: the prediction spans 1.000 to 2.778 across the three exponents. -/
noncomputable def expectedEffectMultiplier (p α : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  (p * (1 - p)) ^ (1 + α)

/-- **The multiplier is symmetric about even frequency and neutral at `α = -1`.** It depends on
the allele only through the heterozygosity `p(1-p)`, so relabelling which allele is counted
cannot change it, and the exponent `1 + α` is zero exactly at the selection parameter where
frequency drops out entirely. -/
