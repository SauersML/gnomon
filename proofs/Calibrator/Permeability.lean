# Permeability of a completed portability experiment

For a centered Gaussian estimator whose covariance in one observed direction is `Σ`, a
deployment tangent changes that covariance at rate `Γ`.  The local Fisher information in
one draw is

`p = 1/2 * (Γ / Σ)^2`.

This is the sound order-two core of the proposed permeability law.  It gives a concrete
method-design score: among candidate LD, haplotype, ancestry-tract, or longitudinal probes,
prefer directions with large covariance sensitivity relative to their own noise.  The
score is invariant to changing genotype coding units and adds across independent probes.

The known-mean centered Gaussian covariance experiment is derived below from its second
and fourth moments, including its exact information--variance constant. No CLT-to-LAN
transfer, Edgeworth hierarchy, universal support-floor model, or general minimax constant
is asserted. Those require a separately named experiment and uniform regularity.

The module also contains one exact direction-sensitive channel: the two-orientation
binary transition experiment from `EnsembleChannel`.  Every order-free readout collapses
the two orientations, while the ordered arrow has unit response, variance `1-θ²`, and
per-pair permeability `1/(1-θ²)`.  This supplies a concrete haplotype/ancestry-transition
positive control when orientation has biological meaning (for example parent-of-origin,
multiple feature channels, or longitudinal state).  Ordinary real scalar LD is
second-order reversal-even, so the calculation is not promoted to a theorem about arbitrary
genomic chains.

/-! ## Constructive lag completion -/

/-- Sensitivity matrix of selected lagged covariance summaries.  Row `i` is the lag
chosen for statistic `i`; column `j` is deployment coordinate `j`.  Its entries are the
derivatives `∂γ(lag i)/∂h_j` supplied by a named LD, haplotype, ancestry-tract, or
longitudinal model. -/

/-- **Constructive completion criterion.** A set of `d` lagged covariance statistics
locally distinguishes all `d` deployment directions exactly when the model-supplied
sensitivity matrix is nonsingular.  This is the actionable form of lag completion:
candidate lags are accepted by a determinant check, not merely by counting them.

For PGS portability the coordinates can represent, for example, ancestry-tract age,
recombination-scale LD decay, selection-induced long haplotypes, and a phase/location
parameter.  The theorem is model agnostic about those meanings but exact once their
covariance derivatives are supplied. -/

/-- **Completion and permeability coincide at order two.** With nonzero estimator
covariances and a nonsingular lag-sensitivity matrix, total Gaussian permeability is zero
exactly for the zero deployment tangent.  Consequently every genuine local population
shift is visible to at least one selected lag channel.

This does not turn marginal allele-frequency data into LD data: the selected lagged
statistics explicitly break the order-erasure gauge. -/
