# What the frequency spectrum cannot determine

`FrequencySpectrumStability` proves the sharp inverse exponent `1 / (2K - 3)` for histories
restricted to at most `K` epochs.  That exponent is a statement about a finite-dimensional
sieve, and this file is the reason the restriction is not a technicality: without it there is
no exponent at all, because the inverse is not a function.

The mechanism is one convergent series.  Writing the history in coalescent time, the expected
time to the first coalescence among `m` lineages is the Laplace transform of the rescaled
history at the Kingman rate `a m = m (m - 1) / 2`, and the whole expected spectrum at every
sample size is a linear encoding of those values.  So the spectrum sees a history only through
`(L N (a m))` for `m ≥ 2`.  After the substitution `x = exp (-τ)` that family is a Müntz
system with exponents `a m - 1`, and the full Müntz theorem on an interval bounded away from
zero says its span is dense exactly when `∑ 1 / a m` diverges.  For Kingman rates the sum
converges — to exactly `2` — so on any interval there is a nonzero function orthogonal to
every exponential the spectrum can test.  Smoothing it keeps it smooth, keeps it supported in
the prescribed epoch, and keeps every Laplace zero.

Three consequences, each formalised below in the general form it actually has.

* **Localisation.** The interval was arbitrary, so an invisible change can be confined to any
  prescribed epoch.  No positive universal resolution kernel exists over an unrestricted
  smoothness class.
* **A constant minimax floor.** Two histories with the same expected spectrum induce the same
  data law at every sample size and every genome length, so no estimator separates them:
  `twoPoint_risk_lower_bound` is that argument, and it is not asymptotic.
* **Fixed sample size is worse still.** For a fixed `n` the spectrum imposes `n` linear
  conditions, so any `n + 1`-parameter family already contains a nonzero invisible direction,
  analyticity included: `exists_invisible_perturbation`.

What survives is stated too.  Ancient perturbations are attenuated at least geometrically in
cumulative coalescent time (`spectrumAttenuation_le_geometric`), which is the operator reading
of the bottleneck phenomenon; and after a finite-dimensional restriction the Laplace core is
exponentially ill-conditioned, so the stable sieve dimension grows like `log L / κ`
(`stableSieveDimension_of_scaled`). A derived linear target is recoverable precisely when it
annihilates the observation kernel (`linearTargetDeterminedByObservation_iff_ker_le`), which
is the usable positive boundary behind estimable demographic functionals. The numerical value
`κ = 2.4103951…`, its
maximiser `θ⋆ = 0.7340955…`, and the resulting genome-size multiplier
`exp κ = 11.1383…` per additional stable dimension come from maximising the Cauchy-matrix
profile below; only the profile and the scaling law are asserted formally, since the
maximisation is a numerical claim.

The companion blindness is in `MultipleMergerBlindness`, which reaches the same conclusion
from the other side of the ladder: after normalisation every Λ-coalescent has the same pairwise
merger rate, so heterozygosity and mean pairwise coalescence time cannot see a multiple-merger
regime at any sample size, while the three-lineage rate identifies it exactly.  That file also
records the divergent reciprocal ladder of the Bolthausen--Sznitman total rate, which is the
precise contrast to `summable_one_div_coalescentRate` here: the Kingman ladder is quadratic and
its reciprocals converge, so the null directions exist; the linear ladder's do not.

Not formalised, and not asserted anywhere: the Müntz density theorem itself, the smoothing
construction, the Denjoy–Carleman threshold (all-sample injectivity holds exactly on
quasianalytic classes), and the asymptotics of the Cauchy Gram matrix.  Those are the analytic
steps; what is here is the algebra they consume and the statistical conclusions they support.

There are three distinct stability regimes, and none supersedes another.  On a fixed linear
span of `r` exponentials the inverse is linear with condition number exponential in `r`.  On
the nonlinear `K`-epoch sieve, colliding boundaries create the sharp Hölder exponent
`1 / (2K - 3)` recorded in `FrequencySpectrumStability`.  On unrestricted ordinary
smoothness classes, the Müntz nullspace makes the model exactly nonidentifiable.  These are,
respectively, linear conditioning, nonlinear collision geometry, and failure of injectivity.

/-! ## The Kingman rate ladder and its reciprocal sum -/

/-- Kingman pair-coalescence rate for `m` lineages, `m (m - 1) / 2`.

    Empirical status: **VALIDATED**
    (`proofs/validation/empirical/simcov/battery_bulk9.py`,
    `test_coalescent_rate_by_ratio`). Measured as a RATIO of waiting times,
    which no time-unit convention can enter:

      ratio        this def   measured             sems
      T(2)/T(3)     3.00000   2.96490±0.02614      1.34
      T(2)/T(4)     6.00000   5.92983±0.04946      1.42
      T(2)/T(6)    15.00000  14.87823±0.11851      1.03
      T(2)/T(8)    28.00000  27.78241±0.21343      1.02

    30000 independent genealogies per lineage count, first-coalescence time
    only. The absolute value of `T(2)` against `Ne` generations is the positive
    control and it passes.

    The ratio form is deliberate. A first attempt compared the absolute rate and
    reported a clean factor of two, which was `ploidy = 1` with
    `population_size = Ne` making msprime measure time in units of `Ne` rather
    than `2 Ne`. A ratio of two quantities measured the same way removes the
    convention rather than requiring it to be got right -- the same move that
    settled the stepping-stone exponent.

    Power: the prediction spans 3 to 28, a factor of nine.

    What is validated is the RATE LADDER, against genealogies simulated under the
    Kingman model. Whether a given real population's genealogy is Kingman at all is a
    different question, and it is the one the identifiability results below leave open. -/

slowly; this says it does not go to zero.  The hypotheses are deliberately weak: `p` is the one

/-! ## After a finite-dimensional restriction: an exponential conditioning law -/

/-- Cauchy-matrix conditioning profile, in the form whose singularities cancel.

The literal integrand `log ((θ² + x²) / |θ² - x²|)` integrates to
`2 [log ((1 + θ²) / (1 - θ²)) + 2θ arctan (1/θ) -
θ log ((1 + θ) / (1 - θ))]`, where the two divergent logarithms cancel as `θ → 1`.
The regrouping below performs that cancellation symbolically, so the profile is finite on
all of `[0, 1]`.

Empirical status: NOT AN EMPIRICAL CLAIM. This is the closed form of an
integral, checked by the theorems below rather than by measurement: an integral
either equals its closed form or does not, and no population bears on which.
The conditioning of the Cauchy matrix it carries IS numerically measurable, but
that is a property of a computation rather than of this identity, and it belongs
to whatever definition states it. -/
