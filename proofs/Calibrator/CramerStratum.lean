# The Cramér stratum, and why atomic laws are outside it

Several results in this development are proved only for coordinate laws satisfying
**Cramér's condition (C)** — the Edgeworth machinery behind the Insertion Lemma needs
it, and the blindness statement it supports is scoped to laws that have it. This file
records what that condition excludes, because the exclusion decides which genotype
data types the surrounding theory may be applied to and the answer is not the one a
casual reading gives.

## The condition

For a coordinate law with characteristic function `φ`, Cramér's condition is

  `limsup_{|t| → ∞} |φ(t)| < 1`.

It says the characteristic function is eventually bounded away from modulus one. A law
with a density has it; a law that returns to modulus one at arbitrarily large
frequencies does not.

We work with `|φ(t)|²` rather than `|φ(t)|`, and write it without complex numbers as

  `charFnSq w a t = ∑_u ∑_v w_u w_v cos(t (a_u - a_v))`,

which is exactly `|φ(t)|²` for the law placing weight `w_v` at value `a_v`. The two
formulations of (C) agree, since `|φ| < 1` iff `|φ|² < 1`, and the real form keeps the
proofs elementary.

## The result, and how much of it is proved here

**Every finitely supported law violates Cramér's condition — lattice or not.** The
characteristic function of a finite atomic measure is a finite exponential sum, hence
Bohr almost periodic, hence *recurrent*: it returns arbitrarily close to `φ(0) = 1` at
arbitrarily large `|t|`. So `limsup |φ| = 1`, and (C), which demands strictly less than
one, fails. The lattice/nonlattice distinction is irrelevant to this — a nonlattice
atomic law fails by recurrence rather than by periodicity, but it fails.

Two halves, with different status here:

* **Lattice atoms: proved outright.** If all gaps lie in `h ℤ` then `charFnSq` is
  *exactly* one at every `t = 2πn/h` (`charFnSq_eq_one_of_lattice`), so (C) fails with
  no analytic input at all (`not_cramer_of_lattice`). This is not a toy case: it is the
  sharpest instance the corpus has, since
  `Calibrator.PolygenicSpectroscopy.hardCall_arithmeticProgression_at_critical_maf`
  proves that at `q* = (2 - √2)/4` the three values of `log x²` for a hard-called
  Hardy-Weinberg locus form an exact arithmetic progression.
* **General atomic: carried as a hypothesis.** The nonlattice atomic case needs
  Kronecker's theorem on *simultaneous* Diophantine approximation — for gaps `1` and
  `√2` one needs `t ≈ 2πm` and `t√2 ≈ 2πn` at once — and mathlib carries only the
  one-dimensional statement (`denseRange_zsmul_iff` and the `AddCircle` ergodic
  results); every `Kronecker` in mathlib is the matrix product. There is no elementary
  shortcut: the mean-value route gives
  `lim (1/2T) ∫_{-T}^{T} |φ|² = ∑_v w_v²`, which is bounded away from one and so says
  nothing about the limsup. So the recurrence is a field of
  `AtomicCramerFailure` rather than a theorem, which puts the Diophantine input where a
  reader can see it is an input.

## Why this matters for genotypes

A standardized diallelic genotype takes three values, so `x²` takes three values and
`log x²` is supported on three points. The coordinate law of a hard-called locus is
therefore atomic, and by the above it is **outside the Cramér stratum at every allele
frequency** — not only at the lattice frequency where the failure is provable here.

The consequence is a scope statement, and it is the useful output of this file:
results proved on the Cramér stratum transfer to **imputed dosages**, which are
continuous per locus and so have absolutely continuous coordinate laws, and do **not**
transfer to hard calls.

Two routes that look like they should repair this do not.

* *Orientation randomization* — mixing a locus with its complementary-frequency
  reflection — is a per-coordinate operation and it does restore reflection symmetry.
  But it acts only on signs: `Calibrator.EpistaticChaos.reflect_standardizedGenotype`
  gives `x_reflect = -(x ∘ flip)`, so the modulus law is exactly invariant and the
  coordinate stays three-atom in `|x|`. Cramér is a condition on the modulus alone, so
  this move provably cannot touch it.
* *Mixing over an allele-frequency spectrum* does smooth the modulus, but only for the
  law of a **randomly chosen** locus. Conditional on a realized marker panel — which is
  what every estimator conditions on — each coordinate is still three-atom. The
  Edgeworth machinery acts per coordinate, so the smoothness is an averaging artifact
  across coordinates rather than a property of any coordinate.

/-- **The general atomic case, with its Diophantine input named.**

For a finitely supported law with incommensurable gaps the characteristic function is
Bohr almost periodic and therefore recurrent, so it returns arbitrarily close to one at
arbitrarily large frequencies. That recurrence is Kronecker's simultaneous
approximation theorem, which mathlib does not carry (only the one-dimensional
`denseRange_zsmul_iff`), so it is a field here rather than a proof.

`recurrence` is exactly the statement that `limsup |φ|² = 1`: for every tolerance and
every threshold there is a frequency past the threshold at which the squared modulus is
within the tolerance of one.

Empirical status: DERIVED, conditional on the named field. The consequence
`not_cramer_of_recurrence` is proved; the recurrence itself is standard harmonic
analysis carried as a hypothesis, not a measurement, and has no free parameter. -/

section HardCalls

/-- **A Hardy-Weinberg locus whose coordinate values are equally spaced is outside the
Cramér stratum.**

The weights are the genotype probabilities, so this is the three-point law of an actual
locus rather than an abstract atomic law. `hlat` is the lattice hypothesis in abstract
form: all gaps between coordinate values lie in `h ℤ`.

Deriving `hlat` for the specific coordinate `log x²` at the critical frequency
`q* = (2 - √2)/4` is *not* done here. What
`Calibrator.PolygenicSpectroscopy.hardCall_arithmeticProgression_at_critical_maf`
proves is the arithmetic-progression identity on the three squared standardized values;
turning that into the gap condition below requires the three logarithms, which this file
does not compute. So the connection is a route, not a discharged hypothesis.

The general statement — that a hard call is outside the stratum at *every* polymorphic
frequency, not only where the values happen to be equally spaced — is
`not_cramer_of_recurrence` applied to the three-point law, and needs the Kronecker
field. -/
