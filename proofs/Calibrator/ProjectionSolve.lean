# The ridge that keeps the projection solve factorizable

`map/project.rs` projects samples onto a fitted PC basis by solving weighted
normal equations per sample.  `build_dense_lower_info_matrix` assembles the
information matrix and adds `WLS_RIDGE = 1e-5` to its diagonal;
`factorize_spd_lower_in_place` then runs a Cholesky factorization and **returns
`false`** the moment a pivot is not finite or not strictly positive, which sends
the caller down a fallback path.

The information matrix is a Gram matrix, so it is positive semidefinite but not
necessarily definite: with fewer informative markers than components, or with a
sample missing every variant loading on some axis, it is singular and the
factorization has no positive pivot to find.  The ridge is what makes the solve
well posed, and `1e-5` is a number in the source with nothing anywhere saying
what it has to satisfy.

This module states what it has to satisfy: **strictly positive**.  That is the
whole requirement, and the results below are the reason.

This is deliberately narrow.  It is not a model of the projection solve -- the
missing-axis renormalization, the sparse/dense missingness split and the
per-sample downdate are not formalized, and saying so is more useful than a
table row claiming otherwise.  What is here is the one invariant the shipped
fallback branch exists to protect.

/-- **The ridge bound.**  On a positive-semidefinite information matrix -- which
a Gram matrix always is -- the regularized form is at least `ridge * ‖x‖²`.

This is the inequality the Cholesky loop needs: it is what stops a pivot from
reaching zero on a rank-deficient design. -/

/-- **A strictly positive ridge makes the solve strictly definite.**  For any
nonzero direction the regularized form is strictly positive, so the matrix the
solver factorizes is positive definite and its Cholesky pivots are strictly
positive.  `factorize_spd_lower_in_place` therefore cannot take its
`diag <= 0.0` failure branch for arithmetic reasons -- only for numerical ones.

The hypothesis is `0 < ridge`, nothing more.  `1e-5` is one admissible choice
and this says so; it also says that `0` is not, which is the content the source
constant carries and does not state. -/

/-- **A zero ridge does not.**  With `ridge = 0` the regularized matrix is the
information matrix itself, so a rank-deficient design keeps a null direction and
the factorization has a zero pivot to find.  This is the failure the constant in
`map/project.rs` is there to prevent, stated rather than assumed. -/
