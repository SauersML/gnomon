assortative mating) pathways.

Key results:
1. Path decomposition of portability loss
2. Mediation analysis for environmental effects
3. Do-calculus for interventions on PGS accuracy
4. Counterfactual portability under hypothetical designs
5. Causal discovery for portability mechanisms

## Path Decomposition of Portability

PGS portability loss can be decomposed into distinct causal pathways,
each contributing a specific proportion of the total loss.
-/

section PathDecomposition

/-- Total portability loss definition.

    Each component represents a distinct causal pathway. -/

    For non-immune traits, LD mismatch accounts for >50% of portability loss. -/

/-- **Selection pathway dominates for immune traits.**
    For immune/pathogen-related traits under divergent selection,
    the effect-turnover factor (ρ < 1) causes additional R² loss
    beyond what drift alone produces. The total immune portability
    loss (source R² minus immune R²) exceeds twice the drift-only
    loss (source R² minus drift-only R²) when ρ is small enough.

    We model this using expectedR2 from PortabilityDrift: drift-only
    uses signal (1-fst)·V_A, immune uses ρ²·(1-fst)·V_A.
    We show the immune R² is strictly below the drift-only R²,
    establishing that effect turnover is a genuine additional
    pathway of portability loss. -/

/-- **LD mediates ancestry → PGS accuracy.**
    Ancestry → LD structure → PGS weights → Accuracy.

    Model: PGS accuracy = expectedR2(vSignal, V_E + V_ld_mismatch).
    Without LD correction, the full mismatch V_ld adds noise.
    With LD correction (using target-population LD matrix), a fraction
    `α` of the mismatch is removed, leaving V_E + (1-α)·V_ld.
    Since 0 < α ≤ 1, the corrected noise is strictly less,
    so R²_corrected > R²_uncorrected by expectedR2 monotonicity.
    A residual gap to source R² (V_E only) remains when α < 1. -/

/-- **Environment mediates ancestry → PGS accuracy.**
    Ancestry → Environment → Phenotype → Accuracy.

    Model: Total phenotypic variance = V_genetic + V_env.
    Phenotypic R² = V_genetic / (V_genetic + V_env).
    Genetic R² (no environmental noise) = V_genetic / V_genetic = 1,
    but more usefully, the phenotypic R² is strictly less than what
    we'd get without environmental variance.  Specifically:
      R²_pheno = expectedR2(V_genetic, V_env) < expectedR2(V_genetic, 0) = 1.
    This shows environment genuinely reduces predictive accuracy;
    the reduction is derived from the variance decomposition, not assumed. -/

## Counterfactual Portability

What would PGS portability look like under hypothetical
alternative study designs?
-/

section CounterfactualPortability

/-- **Counterfactual: diverse training GWAS.**
    If the training GWAS had been done in the target ancestry,
    there is no drift divergence (fst = 0), so presentDayR2
    equals V_A/(V_A + V_E).  Cross-ancestry training with
    fst > 0 gives strictly lower R².  The gap is the
    portability loss attributable to ancestry mismatch. -/

/-- **Counterfactual: WGS eliminates technical artifacts.**
    With array genotyping, imputation error adds noise V_tech to
    the environmental variance, reducing observed R².  WGS removes
    this (V_tech = 0), so the WGS R² exceeds array R².
    The remaining gap from source R² is purely genetic drift. -/

/-- **Counterfactual: infinite sample size.**
    With finite sample, winner's curse inflates effect estimates,
    adding noise V_wc to the prediction.  With n → ∞, V_wc → 0.
    We model finite-sample R² as expectedR2 with signal vSignal
    and noise V_E + V_wc (winner's curse adds prediction error).
    Infinite-sample R² uses noise V_E only.
    The remaining loss (infinite-sample R² vs source R²) is from
    LD mismatch and true effect size differences. -/

/-- **Counterfactual: equalized environments.**
    GxE interaction adds variance V_gxe to the target phenotype,
    inflating environmental noise from V_E to V_E + V_gxe.
    If environments were equalized (V_gxe = 0), the target R²
    would be higher.  The remaining loss is purely from genetic
    architecture differences (drift, LD, effect turnover). -/

can improve PGS portability.

/-- **Intervention hierarchy (most to least effective).**
    Model: each intervention addresses specific MSE components.
    - Original MSE noise: V_E + V_ld + V_power + V_cal
    - Recalibration: fixes intercept only, removes V_cal.
      Noise = V_E + V_ld + V_power.
    - LD correction: partially reduces LD mismatch by fraction α (0 < α < 1).
      Noise = V_E + (1 - α) · V_ld + V_power.
    - Meta-analysis: larger sample removes power loss, reduces LD loss
      further (fraction β where α < β < 1).
      Noise = V_E + (1 - β) · V_ld.
    - New GWAS in target: eliminates LD mismatch and power loss entirely.
      Noise = V_E.
    The ordering is derived from the noise levels being strictly decreasing,

## Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis quantifies how robust portability estimates
are to violations of modeling assumptions.
-/

section SensitivityAnalysis

/- **Derivation: E-value from the confounding bounding formula.**

    The E-value (VanderWeele & Ding, 2017) is the minimum strength of
    unmeasured confounding on the risk ratio scale that could fully explain
    away an observed association. We derive E = RR + √(RR(RR-1)).

    **Setup.** Let RR_obs be the observed risk ratio. An unmeasured
    confounder U introduces bias through two pathways:
    - RR_{EU}: the confounder-exposure association (risk ratio)
    - RR_{UD}: the confounder-outcome association (risk ratio)

    **Step 1: The Cornfield/bounding inequality.**
    The maximum bias factor B from an unmeasured confounder satisfies:
        B ≤ (RR_{EU} × RR_{UD}) / (RR_{EU} + RR_{UD} - 1)
    The observed RR relates to the true RR via: RR_obs = RR_true × B.

    **Step 2: Setting up the E-value equation.**
    The E-value asks: what is the minimum confounding strength E such that
    B = RR_obs (i.e., RR_true = 1, the association is fully explained)?
    For the sharpest bound, set RR_{EU} = RR_{UD} = E (symmetric
    confounding). Then:
        RR_obs = E² / (2E - 1)

    **Step 3: Solving for E.**
    Rearranging RR = E²/(2E - 1):
        RR × (2E - 1) = E²
        E² - 2·RR·E + RR = 0
    By the quadratic formula:
        E = (2·RR ± √(4·RR² - 4·RR)) / 2
          = RR ± √(RR² - RR)
          = RR ± √(RR(RR - 1))
    Taking the positive root (E ≥ RR ≥ 1):
        **E = RR + √(RR(RR - 1))**

    **Verification.** When RR = 1: E = 1 + 0 = 1 (no confounding needed).
    As RR → ∞: E ≈ 2·RR (confounding must be roughly twice the observed
    association on the RR scale). -/
