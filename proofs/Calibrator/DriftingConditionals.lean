# Drifting conditionals in finite biological state spaces

This module wires the finite, self-contained core of the drifting-conditionals
calculus into the population-genetics development. The state type can represent
ancestry, deme, local haplotype state, or an environmental stratum.

The analytic diffusion, infinite-dimensional realization, and observability
claims from the source derivation are not smuggled in as assumptions here. The
results below need only finite sums and are proved directly:

* a frozen binary mark and the population mass are transported by one kernel;
* row-stochastic transport preserves marked prevalence exactly;
* the transported response curve reconstructs the transported marked mass;
* the imported identification layer separates static threshold gauge from
  dynamically identifiable threshold motion; and
* symmetric two-state ancestry switching acts on the ancestry contrast through
  the persistence eigenvalue already used by `ReversibleMarkovSpectrum`.

These are the pieces used by the biological core. Stronger manifold-rigidity,
backward-parabolic, and cited spectral-rate claims require separate formal
developments and are deliberately absent rather than represented by theorem
parameters.

/-! ## The portability law: which half of a calibration curve survives drift

A response curve on two ancestry states splits into a baseline (its mean) and a
score-dependent part (its contrast component). Repeated ancestry switching fixes the first
exactly and damps the second geometrically. That asymmetry is the portability law, and it
is the structural reason a recalibration that models the score distribution but not the
baseline loses the component with the longer half-life.

    toward local prevalence at a geometric rate set by how fast ancestry mixes.

    The practical reading, which is why this is stated about a curve rather than about an
    eigenvalue: a recalibration that adjusts the score distribution but does not model the
    baseline discards precisely the component that survives longest. Far from training, the
    surviving content of a score is the local base rate. -/

/-! ## The drifting probit index, and the constraint tying its two surfaces

Under Ornstein-Uhlenbeck drift of the covariate the probit single-index family
`Phi (a t * x + b t)` is carried to itself, with

  `a t = a0 * exp (-lam * t) / sqrt (1 + a0 ^ 2 * ouVariance lam t)`,
  `b t = b0 / sqrt (1 + a0 ^ 2 * ouVariance lam t)`.

The two surfaces share one denominator. That the family is invariant is an analytic fact
about the Gaussian semigroup which is NOT proved here; what is proved here is the algebraic
consequence, and it is the part a fitted model can be tested against.

    A structure whose every construction takes a hypothesis can still be empty, and then
    every theorem quantified over it holds vacuously -- kernel-checked, clean axiom report,
    no content. This is the witness that makes the horizon theorems statements about
    something. -/

/-- **The intercept and slope surfaces are not independent.**

    Their ratio is a single exponential in drift time with one rate:
    `b t / a t = (b0 / a0) * exp (lam * t)`. The shared `probitScaleFactor` cancels, so
    this needs nothing about the denominator beyond its being nonzero -- in particular it
    does not depend on the analytic invariance claim above.

    Two consequences, and they are the reason this is here rather than in prose.

    Fitting: an intercept surface and a slope surface estimated in separately penalized
    blocks carry one degree of freedom more than the drift model permits. Imposing this
    constraint removes it and leaves one interpretable parameter, the drift rate `lam`.

    Testing: `log (b t / a t)` is affine in `t` with slope `lam`. Curvature in that plot
    refutes Ornstein-Uhlenbeck drift rather than the fit, so this is falsifiable against
    data the corpus already produces.

    Empirical status: UNTESTED, and the test just described is how that changes. -/

/-- The scale parameter `A = a ^ (-2)` linearizes the slope dynamics: if
    `a' = -lam * a - a ^ 3 / 2` then `A' = 2 * lam * A + 1`.

    Stated as the algebraic identity the derivative relation reduces to, so it is checkable
    without carrying a derivative. This linearization is what makes the closed form for the
    slope surface integrable in the first place. -/
