### High-dimensionality projection
Because the biobank and the single individual are standardized on the same reference, and placed on the same per-axis scale, the directional geometry is preserved. Fitting on the projected biobank means residual magnitude shrinkage is just a shared, axis-wise rescaling, so both a single new datapoint and the biobank data inhabit the same commensurately shrunken space and distances. Consequently, de-shrinkage or OADP/AP rotations would merely re-inflate coordinates and risk needless perturbation.

### Missing SNVs
If we project onto a unit vector made only from the SNVs we have, missing SNVs don’t contribute signal or variance; their loading mass is subtracted from the denominator and the axis is renormalized. The projection for each PC is then computed only from those overlapping SNVs (i.e. the same as mean imputation after normalization). We take the standardized genotype values at the overlapping loci, weight them by the corresponding loadings, and sum. Because loadings for missing loci were effectively dropped, we renormalize the axis using the amount of loading mass that remains—i.e., divide by the Euclidean norm of the retained loadings—so we're still projecting onto a unit-length axis defined solely by the SNVs we actually have. Drop missing SNVs, rebuild the axis from the overlap, rescale it to unit length.
