Because the biobank and the single individual are standardized on the same reference, and placed on the same per-axis scale, the directional geometry is preserved. Fitting on the projected biobank means residual magnitude shrinkage is just a shared, axis-wise rescaling, so both a single new datapoint and the biobank data inhabit the same commensurately shrunken space and distances. Consequently, de-shrinkage or OADP/AP rotations would merely re-inflate coordinates and risk needless perturbation.
