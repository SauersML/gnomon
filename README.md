# gnomon

Wiktionary gives this etymology:
>Borrowed from French gnomon, or directly from its etymon Latin gnōmōn, or directly from its etymon Ancient Greek γνώμων (gnṓmōn, “discerner, interpreter; carpenter’s square; gnomon of a sundial; (geometry) gnomon”), from γιγνώσκω (gignṓskō, “to be aware of; to perceive; to know”), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ǵneh₃- (“to know”); the word is thus related to know.

The word "gnomon" shares a root with the Ancient Greek γνώμη (gnṓmē), meaning means of knowing or judgement, gnôma, meaning "sign" or "symptom," the Finnish word "kone," meaning "machine," "kunją," meaning "omen," Sanskrit ज्ञा (jñā), meaning "to know," Jñāna (knowledge, in Indian philosophy), and the English word "know."
