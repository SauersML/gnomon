# gnomon

Wiktionary gives this etymology:
>Borrowed from French gnomon, or directly from its etymon Latin gnōmōn, or directly from its etymon Ancient Greek γνώμων (gnṓmōn, “discerner, interpreter; carpenter’s square; gnomon of a sundial; (geometry) gnomon”), from γιγνώσκω (gignṓskō, “to be aware of; to perceive; to know”), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ǵneh₃- (“to know”); the word is thus related to know.

The word "gnomon" shares a root with the Ancient Greek γνώμη (gnṓmē), meaning means of knowing or judgement, gnôma, meaning "sign" or "symptom," the Finnish word "kone," meaning "machine," and "kunją," meaning "omen."
