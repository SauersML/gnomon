# Instrumented Lean build against the shared cluster checkout.
#
# Run this from the relay, never on this laptop:
#
#   /Users/user/msi-node/msi 'bash /projects/standard/hsiehph/sauer354/gnomon/scripts/cluster-lean-build.sh Calibrator.ProjectionShiftBounds Calibrator.MetricSpecificPortability'
#
# with no arguments it builds the whole Calibrator target.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# On 2026-08-02 a build report meant nothing five separate times, each with a
# different cause and the same symptom:
#
#   1. the relay killed the process tree when the call returned, so a job that
#      ran for 25 minutes wrote nothing;
#   2. `lake` was absent from the relay's PATH, so the job died instantly in a
#      way that reads as "never started";
#   3. an `&&` chain aborted at a stuck `git pull`, so lake never ran;
#   4. concurrent `lake build` against one checkout serialised on the package
#      lock in `.lake`, parking at high wall clock and near-zero CPU;
#   5. the reader counted `^error:` and matched a *git* line -- "the following
#      untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge" -- so a job
#      in which lake never ran reported "1 error", which read as PROGRESS
#      against the previous run's count.
#
# The fifth is the worst, because the other four produce an absence and it
# produced a plausible number. A build that never happened was indistinguishable
# from a nearly-clean one.
#
# The rule the five share: A MEASUREMENT THAT CANNOT REPORT ITS OWN ABSENCE WILL
# EVENTUALLY REPORT SOMEONE ELSE'S ANSWER AS ITS OWN. So this script makes the
# log say what happened to it.
#

#

#   COVERAGE_EXIT=0|1                                 did the build cover the corpus?
#   WHOLE_CORPUS_INCOMPLETE=0|1                       full build left work undone
#   STALE_MTIME_ONLY=<n>                              stale mtimes, lake says clean
#
#   COVERAGE_EXIT=1 or WHOLE_CORPUS_INCOMPLETE=1 exits the script with code 3 even
#   when LAKE_EXIT=0. THAT COMBINATION IS THE POINT: lake can succeed on every
#   target it was given and still have compiled none of the modules you care
#   about. `LAKE_EXIT=0` means "the targets built", never "the corpus is green".
#
#   STALE_MTIME_ONLY is the deliberately NON-fatal case: `git merge` bumps source
#   mtimes, lake skips the rebuild on content traces, and the olean ends up older
#   than its source without anything being wrong. The first run of the coverage
#   guard fired on four such modules in a build with LAKE_EXIT=0 and zero errors.
#   A guard that fires on the normal case gets ignored -- so ABSENT (no olean at
#   all, never built under any reading) is fatal, while STALE is fatal only when
#   lake ALSO failed.
#
# HOW TO READ A LOG, in order. Absence is the signal:
#
#   no BUILT_AT_REV   -> the job died before sync finished. No build happened.
#   TOOLCHAIN_DAMAGED -> treat error lists as SUSPECT, not as void, and see
#                        "ON THE 59" below before concluding anything. A
#                        damaged olean chain really can report definitions that
#                        exist as unknown identifiers -- but on 2026-08-02 that
#                        explanation was applied to a 59-error list and builds
#                        were halted for hours, and the errors turned out to be
#                        REAL. The root cause was a namespace boundary, not a
#                        broken chain: five declarations in
#                        `Calibrator.TransportedMetrics` were referenced bare,
#                        and Lean AUTO-BINDS an unresolved bare name as an
#                        implicit variable rather than reporting it missing,
#                        which is why one cause produced three different error
#                        texts ("unknown identifier", "function expected at",
#                        and the discriminating "LOCAL VARIABLE ... has no
#                        definition").
#                        The lesson: a plausible mechanism that explains the
#                        symptom is not a diagnosis. BUILD SOMETHING SMALL --
#                        one leaf module -- and see whether it is clean. That
#                        test takes minutes and settles it.
#
#                        AUTO-BINDING RECURRED TWICE ON 2026-08-02 EVENING, and
#                        the two cases wanted OPPOSITE repairs. Test which you
#                        have with a two-second grep for the bare name before
#                        theorising -- that grep settles it either way, and it
#                        correctly falsified this hypothesis for four other
#                        files the same evening.
#
#                          CausalInference: 35 errors, two texts, one cause.
#                          `r2FromSignalVariance` moved into
#                          `Calibrator.TransportedMetrics`, and OPEN DOES NOT
#                          TRAVEL THROUGH IMPORT -- the `open` that
#                          `OpenQuestions` added for itself did nothing for a
#                          file that imports `OpenQuestions`. That is how a
#                          consumer gets missed. Repair: add the `open`.
#
#                          Conventions: same two texts, and `open` would have
#                          been WRONG. The bare name was the left side of a
#                          bridge theorem `bare = TransportedMetrics.bare`
#                          whose local definition had been deleted. Adding the
#                          `open` would have made it
#                          `TransportedMetrics.X = TransportedMetrics.X`, i.e.
#                          silently converted a build error into a VACUOUS
#                          theorem -- and its neighbour was already exactly
#                          that, `X = X` proved by `unfold X X`. Repair:
#                          delete the dead bridge.
#
#                        So: `open` is right only when the bare name has a real
#                        referent AND the statement stays non-vacuous. CHECK
#                        THAT THE TWO SIDES STILL DIFFER before adding it.
#
#   A FILE THAT FAILS TO PARSE HAS NO ERROR COUNT. `unexpected token 'end';
#                        expected 'lemma'` and friends TRUNCATE the measured
#                        region: everything below the parse error is never
#                        elaborated, so the file's error count is a FLOOR, not
#                        a measurement. On 2026-08-02 `DemographicHistory`
#                        reported "2 errors" while everything below line 69 was
#                        unmeasured. This is the same defect as an error count
#                        without a commit and an error count without a
#                        MODULE_STATUS: a number that looks like a measurement
#                        and is a lower bound. Grep the error list for parse
#                        errors FIRST -- `unexpected token`, `expected` -- and
#                        treat any file carrying one as UNMEASURED, not as
#                        nearly clean.
#   `-/` INSIDE PROSE ENDS THE COMMENT. A doc comment containing the ordinary
#                        phrase `low-/high-frequency` closes at that slash: the
#                        remaining prose is parsed as commands and the file dies
#                        with `unexpected identifier; expected command` dozens of
#                        lines later, nowhere near the cause. Cost a whole-corpus
#                        build on 2026-08-02. When a parse error points at plain
#                        English, search the comment ABOVE it for `-/`; the usual
#                        sources are `X-/Y` alternatives and arrow-like glyphs.
#   no LAKE_EXIT      -> lake was killed or is still running. INCOMPLETE, not
#                        clean; a truncated log with few errors is not a result.
#   LAKE_EXIT=0       -> build succeeded.
#   otherwise         -> count Lean errors, and ONLY Lean errors:
#
#       grep -c '^error: proofs/'      <- correct
#       grep -c '^error:'              <- WRONG, matches git and lake messages
#
#   READING LEAN ERRORS: THREE SHAPES OF "unfold failed", ALL PRINTING THE SAME
#   MESSAGE AND ALL WANTING DIFFERENT REPAIRS. Found the hard way on
#   2026-08-02, across DGP and PortabilityDrift:
#
#     (a) THE NAME MOVED.       A definition no longer routes through the name
#                               being unfolded. Repair: restore the routing.
#                               Canonical instance, 2026-08-02:
#                               `PopulationGeneticsFoundations.hetDecayFactor`
#                               still RE-TYPED the body of
#                               `hetDecayFromScaled` instead of delegating to
#                               it, so `unfold hetDecayFactor
#                               hetDecayFromScaled` unfolded the copy and then
#                               found no second name left in the goal. A
#                               half-done "one home each" move looks exactly
#                               like a missing reducibility attribute. Repair
#                               is to DELEGATE, not to drop the second name --
#                               dropping it hides the duplicated body, which
#                               was the actual defect, and the same latent
#                               break was sitting in `Conventions` and
#                               `DemographicHistory`.
#     (b) THE REQUEST IS
#         IMPOSSIBLE.           The name is an inductive CONSTRUCTOR, e.g.
#                               `Pop.source`. Constructors have no body, so this
#                               could never have worked. Repair: DELETE the
#                               token; the surrounding proof is fine.
#     (c) THE REQUEST IS
#         REDUNDANT.            `unfold` is NOT idempotent. A name listed twice
#                               unfolds on the first occurrence and ERRORS on
#                               the second, because the constant is gone by
#                               then. Repair: delete the duplicate.
#
#   The message cannot distinguish these, and reading (b) as (a) sends you
#   hunting for reducibility attributes that do not exist. CHECK WHAT THE NAME
#   IS before theorising: `inductive` constructor, or `def`?
#
#   AND THE GENERAL FORM OF THAT TRAP, which cost the most time of anything
#   today: A TOOL REPORTS THE FAILURE IT CAN EXPRESS, NOT THE FAILURE THAT
#   OCCURRED. The clearest instance was `linarith failed to find a
#   contradiction` whose actual cause was a MISSING SIMP LEMMA: a `@[simp]`
#   pair had one half stated (`residualBurden_source`) and the other missing,
#   so target-side facts were phrased about one name while goals said another.
#   `linarith` was handed a hypothesis about a term ABSENT FROM ITS GOAL and
#   truthfully reported that it could not close the arithmetic. Nobody would
#   reach "missing bridge lemma" from that message. So when a tactic fails on
#   something that looks obviously true, READ THE PRINTED GOAL and check that
#   every hypothesis you supplied actually mentions a term that occurs in it.
#
#   THEN, AND THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL, check MODULE_STATUS for the files you care
#   about. "NO ERRORS FOR FILE X" IS ONLY MEANINGFUL IF X COMPILED. On
#   2026-08-02 a cancelled build produced a log with zero errors in
#   PortabilityDrift; the file was 76 seconds into compiling and its olean was
#   stale, so the clean record was absence of evidence and the 59-error cluster
#   it appeared to clear was still entirely unmeasured. A killed, cancelled or
#   timed-out build leaves a log INDISTINGUISHABLE from a clean partial one.
#
#   The mtime comparison is the sixth check added to this file and the only one
#   that catches all six causes at once, because it tests the ARTIFACT rather
#   than the log: whatever went wrong -- relay kill, missing PATH, aborted &&
#   chain, lock deadlock, miscounted grep, cancellation -- an olean older than
#   its source means that module was not built. An error count without a
#   compiled-module list is the same defect as an error count without a commit.
#
# Always quote BUILT_AT_REV when reporting a count. An error list without a
# commit is not evidence; that rule cost this effort three false reports before
# it was adopted.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# BEFORE YOU RUN IT
#
# * ONE BUILD AT A TIME against the shared checkout. Concurrent invocations
#   serialise on the `.lake` package lock and nobody finishes. A private clone
#   only helps if its `.lake` is genuinely COPIED -- `cp -al` hardlinks and a
#   symlink both share the lock inode and deadlock identically.
# * Diagnose a suspected deadlock by CPU TIME, not by the log:
#       ps -eo pid=,etimes=,time=,args= | grep -E 'lake|lean'
#   parked on the lock  = large elapsed, near-zero CPU.
#   never started       = neither.
#   actually working    = CPU climbing.
# * DO NOT REBUILD MATHLIB CASUALLY. Check the count first:
#       find .lake/packages/mathlib/.lake/build/lib/lean -name '*.olean' | wc -l
#
#   `lake exe cache get` DOES NOT WORK ON THIS CLUSTER. Verified 2026-08-02, and
#   the reason is not what it looks like: the download is fine, but `cache` is a
#   Lean EXECUTABLE that lake must compile first, and compiling anything to
#   native code needs the toolchain's clang, which cannot start here --
#       clang: /lib64/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found
#              (required by .../libclang-cpp.so.19.1 and .../libLLVM.so.19.1)
#   while every node ships GLIBC 2.28 (`ldd --version` -> 2.28). So the advice
#   this file used to give -- "restore in minutes with cache get" -- sends you
#   to a dead end, and recompiling Mathlib from source is currently the ONLY
#   path to a complete Mathlib. Budget hours, submit it once, centrally, and let
#   it finish rather than cancelling and restarting.
#
#   Note WHY .olean builds still work while `cache` does not: producing an olean
#   is pure Lean elaboration and never invokes clang. Only native-code targets
#   (executables, `:c.o`) need it. That is the whole difference.
#
#   UNTESTED LEAD, worth ten minutes before anyone budgets hours again: system
#   `gcc` is 8.5.0 and DOES compile against the Lean headers here (verified with
#   a trivial translation unit and `-I <toolchain>/include`). If lake honours
#   `LEAN_CC=gcc`, `cache get` may build and the whole problem evaporates. I did
#   not run it, because doing so writes into a shared tree during someone else's
#   rebuild. Try it in an isolated clone first.
# * Never run heavy compute on a login node; submit with sbatch.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NEGATIVE RESULT: DO NOT REBUILD THE "DUPLICATE unfold ARGUMENT" SCANNER.
#
# Having found one `unfold` list that named the same constant twice, the
# obvious next move is a scan over every `unfold` block in a file. I wrote it
# on 2026-08-02. IT REPORTED TEN HITS, OF WHICH ONE WAS REAL, and it is not
# fixable by tightening the regex in any way I could see.
#
# The reason is structural. An `unfold` tactic's argument list continues onto
# following lines by INDENTATION, and the tactic lines that follow it are
# indented too. So any indent-based capture swallows the subsequent `have`,
# `exact` and `simp` lines, and then reports ordinary repeated words -- `have`,
# `exact`, `0`, `:=`, `by` -- as duplicate unfold arguments. Distinguishing a
# continued argument list from the next tactic needs the parser, not a regex.
#
# IT WAS NOT COMMITTED AND ITS OUTPUT WAS NOT USED AS EVIDENCE. The rule this
# is an instance of: a detector with a 90% false-positive rate is WORSE THAN NO
# DETECTOR, because it gets ignored within a day and its real hits become
# invisible along with the noise. Most checks that fail here fail by being
# unable to FIRE; this one fails by firing too easily, and that is equally
# disqualifying. The real duplicate was found by the compiler, which is the
# tool that actually parses the file.

# This tests the ARTIFACT, not the log, and that is the whole point. Every
# other check in this file infers what happened from what lake printed; this
# one asks the filesystem whether each module's olean is newer than its source.
# An olean older than its source means that module WAS NOT BUILT in this run,
# no matter how clean the log looks.
#
# It exists because on 2026-08-02 a cancelled build produced a log with zero
# errors in PortabilityDrift, which read as a 59-error cluster cleared. The
# file had been compiling for 76 seconds when the job was cancelled and its
# olean was stale. "No errors for file X" is only meaningful if X compiled, and
# a killed, cancelled or timed-out build is indistinguishable from a clean
# partial one at the level of the log.
#
# Note the asymmetry that makes this worth running unprompted: a module can be
# STALE because it failed, or because the build never reached it, and BOTH look
# like silence. Only ABSENT/STALE/COMPILED distinguishes "clean" from "not
# attempted".

# COVERAGE GUARD. THE BUILD MUST COVER ITS OWN CORPUS.
#
# On 2026-02 this script reported zero errors on whole-corpus builds, repeatedly,
# while eight modules were never compiled at all: `Calibrator.ResonanceSpectrum`
# and seven `Calibrator.BundleRigidity.*` submodules sat outside the import
# closure of `proofs/Calibrator.lean`, so `lake build Calibrator` never reached
# them. Naming them as explicit targets produced errors immediately -- a missing
# `Real.log` import that had been red all day. The root module itself was also
# never elaborated until `CondensationUnification` compiled, and it was carrying
# a theorem over two names that have never been defined in this corpus.
#
# So every "0 errors" excluded the one file that transitively covers everything.
# MODULES_ABSENT was reporting this truthfully the whole time, as a line in a
# summary that nobody interrogated. A count is not a signal until something
# fails on it. This is that something.
#
# The orphan check below is the durable half, and it does NOT depend on the
# build succeeding: it compares the files on disk against the transitive import
# closure of the root module. A file that no target can reach is UNBUILT, not
# clean, and adding it here is not the fix -- adding it to the ROOT is.
